1590

and they go down to a little lava pool,

1591
01:10:08,959 --> 01:10:10,586
and they hold hands over the hot lava,

1592
01:10:10,752 --> 01:10:13,005
and then, after a month,
they pull their hands apart

1593
01:10:13,088 --> 01:10:14,232
and they find they've created

1594
01:10:14,256 --> 01:10:16,175
a beautiful new Kronan baby boy.

1595
01:10:16,258 --> 01:10:18,802
Mm, fascinating. And hot. (CHUCKLES)

I don't know if I want that again.

1600
01:10:27,811 --> 01:10:29,372
Is that because you lost
your girlfriend in battle

1601
01:10:29,396 --> 01:10:30,522
and never forgave yourself?

1602
01:10:30,606 --> 01:10:31,732

1603
01:10:31,815 --> 01:10:33,334
to find answers in the bottom of a bottle,

1604
01:10:33,358 --> 01:10:34,860
or some meaningless dalliance,

1605
01:10:34,943 --> 01:10:36,303
which only serves to numb the pain

1606
01:10:36,361 --> 01:10:37,446
