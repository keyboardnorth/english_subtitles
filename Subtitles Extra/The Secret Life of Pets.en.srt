2
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,358
Illumination!
Illumination!

3
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,320
I've lived in this city
all my life.

4
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,149
I'm Max.

5
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,874
And I'm the luckiest dog
in New York

6
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,758
because of her.

7
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,273
That's Katie.

8
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,440
Katie and I...

9
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,272
Well, we have
the perfect relationship.

10
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,599
We met a few years ago.

11
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,909
And, boy, let me tell ya,

12
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,429
we got along right away.

13
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,816
It was one of those
relationships

14
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,717
where you just know.

15
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,795
And get this!

16
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,952
She was looking for a roommate.
And so was I!

17
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:59,078
So I just moved
in that same day.

18
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,878
It was perfect.

19
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,431
We've been together ever since.

20
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,715
Katie would do anything for me.

21
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,757
And I'm her loyal protector.

22
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,680
Our love is...

23
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,912
How do I put this?

24
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,832
Our love is stronger than words.

25
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,717
Or shoes.

26
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,108
It's me and Katie.

27
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,753
Katie and me.

28
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,558
Us against the world.

29
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,918
I wouldn't go so far as
to call us soul mates,

30
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,429
even though any sane person
who saw us would.

31
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,755
There's just one little problem.

32
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,110
Pretty much every day...

33
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,280
Come on, Max.

34
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,435
...she leaves.

35
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,789
I'll see you tonight.

36
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,833
Sometimes I try stuff
to get her to stay.

37
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,279
Okay.

38
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,589
Sit.

39
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,839
Spin.

40
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,835
Speak.

41
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,875
Okay.
That's a good boy.

42
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,672
But it never works.

43
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,353
Where is she going?

44
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,788
What could she
possibly be doing?

45
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,832
Oh, I miss her so much.

46
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,358
Oh my!
She's back!

47
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,509
Forgot my phone.

48
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,790
What took so long?
Why did you...

49
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,155
Oh, come on!

50
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,760
Oh!

51
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,560
I miss her so much.

52
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,194
Bye, Gidget.
Be a good doggy.

53
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,874
Hey, Max.

54
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,075
Hey, Gidget.

55
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,633
Any plans today?

56
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,760
Uh, yes.

57
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,876
Big, big stuff today,
Gidget. I got big plans.

58
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,997
I'm gonna sit here, and I'm gonna
wait for Katie to come back.

59
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,513
Oh, that sounds exciting.

60
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,232
Well, I won't interrupt.

61
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,153
I've got a very busy day, too.

62
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,437
Here you go.
See you later, Chloe.

63
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,038
Bye, Peppy.

64
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,988
So long, Mel.

65
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,876
Bye, Sweetpea.

66
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,110
See you, Gino.

67
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,719
Bye, Mr. Wiggles.
So long, pal.

68
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,960
I'll miss you, Shelly!

69
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,349
Later, Runty.

70
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,480
Bye, everyone.

71
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,794
Bye.

72
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,594
Mmm.

73
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,936
You be a good boy, Leonard.

74
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,429
Hey, Max.

75
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,797
Hey, Chloe, do you ever wonder
where they go during the day?

76
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,353
Do you know what?
I just...

77
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,999
I don't really care.

78
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,878
Maybe that's what
it's like for you,

79
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,840
but Katie and I have
a different relationship.

80
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,155
You're a cat.
So maybe that's why.

81
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,720
Because nobody could ever love
a cat the way they love a dog.

82
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,791
I'm just saying.
Maybe that's why.

83
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,110
Whatever you need
to tell yourself.

84
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,553
Hey! Morning, Max!

85
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,640
Hey, guys.

86
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,077
What's up, Sweetpea?

87
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,790
Hey, Mel, where you been, man?

88
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,188
Oh! Get this!

89
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,358
Last Sunday, my owner feeds
me a small white pill, right?

90
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,192
I start to feel a little groggy.

91
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:55,033
The next thing I know,
I wake up, I'm in the sky!

92
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,713
Wait a minute. The sky?

93
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,394
Yeah. There are suitcases everywhere.
I'm locked up in a crate.

94
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,790
Come on.
There are suitcases in the sky?

95
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,309
So, I pass out from fear,
and when I wake up

96
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,311
I'm in Florida.

97
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,674
Um. This
did not happen.

98
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,916
I will never eat a
pill like that again.

99
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,553
Unless it's covered
in peanut butter.

100
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,991
Because, I mean, come on! Right?
It's peanut butter!

101
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,200
Hey, guys.

102
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,634
Oh, hey, Norman.

103
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,576
You still looking for your apartment?

104
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,830
Yeah. Going
on three weeks now.

105
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,752
Is this the second
or the third floor?

106
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,713
I don't know any numbers, but, uh,
you don't live here.

107
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,239
Ah! Pellets!

108
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,268
Well, see you guys later.

109
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,991
You know what?
You can do it!

110
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,679
He can't do it.

111
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,558
Buddy!
There you are.

112
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,800
Did you find it?

113
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,396
You know I did.

114
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,349
Ball!

115
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,714
Ball, ball, ball!

116
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,958
Katie's gonna be so excited!

117
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,917
This is exactly like
the one she lost!

118
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,274
I mean, look at it!

119
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,396
It's round.
It fits in my mouth.

120
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,394
Ball!

121
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,760
Ooh!

122
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,995
There is no other
ball in the city

123
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,196
like this one ball, guaranteed.
Whoa!

124
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,913
This is the ball.

125
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,792
Hey.
Katie!

126
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,711
I'm home, Max.

127
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,548
Hey, Maximilian.

128
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,159
How was your day, buddy?

129
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,958
That's a good boy.

130
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,271
Oh, yes. I'm so psyched
to see you too, buddy.

131
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,317
Okay, boy.
Calm down, it's okay.

132
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,754
Let's all be calm.

133
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,434
Now, I have some big news.

134
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:46,070
I know this'll take some getting used to,

135
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,389
but I think it's gonna be a
great thing in the long...

136
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,480
Oh!

137
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,309
Max, this is Duke.

138
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,316
He's going to be your

139
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,515
brother.

140
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,512
No, Max.

141
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,352
It's gonna be all right, Duke.

142
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,033
It's okay.

143
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,158
Aww. See?
He likes you.

144
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,839
Whoa!

145
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,879
Aww.

146
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,873
Yeah, that's it, Duke.
Take a look around.

147
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:29,477
I know, buddy.
This is a lot to take in.

148
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,552
But he didn't have a home.

149
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,792
So you and I are gonna have
to take care of him.

150
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,029
Okay?

151
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,913
Oh, my gosh!

152
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,031
Duke found our lost ball!

153
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,515
What a great team we're gonna be.

154
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,718
Love you, Maxie.

155
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,199
Love you, Duke.

156
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,559
Sleep tight, boys.

157
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,960
Psst.

158
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,440
Psst.

159
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,955
Hey. Little guy.

160
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,720
This place is so great!

161
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,229
Uh-huh.
By the way...

162
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,311
That is one gorgeous bed.

163
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,072
Yeah, it's okay.

164
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,309
Maybe we could share?

165
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,830
You know, one night you get the bed.
The next night, I do.

166
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,115
That kind of thing.

167
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,713
You know, this bed is mine.

168
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,592
You? You get
an old blanket.

169
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,835
That suits you.

170
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,675
You're an old-blanket kind of a dog.
Oh, wow.

171
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,796
You are stubborn.

172
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,554
Hey, I get it.
I'm stubborn, too.

173
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,736
But we gotta learn to get along.
Wait. What are you...

174
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,796
I bet we can both fit in
this bed if we really try.

175
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,995
Let me scoot on in there.

176
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,639
No, wait.
Ah!

177
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,314
Perfect. This is
comfy, right?

178
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,152
No, it is not.

179
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,431
I'm comfy.

180
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,035
Duke is just ruining our lives!

181
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,430
It's an emergency that
you get rid of this dog.

182
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,520
He stole my...

183
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,158
And he's scary,
and he's frightening,

184
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,117
and he's the death
of all good things.

185
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,350
Aww. You little
cutie pie.

186
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,311
We'll play tomorrow,
buddy, okay?

187
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,629
Okay, sleep well.

188
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,596
Are you trying to get rid of me?

189
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,676
Before I answer that...

190
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,115
I'd like to know
how much you heard.

191
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,117
So, that's how
it's gonna be, huh?

192
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,475
Oh, man, are you
making me angry!

193
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,438
And when I get angry, I do this.

194
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,594
And I don't want to do that.

195
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,312
I need this place.

196
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,869
And if it's gonna
come down to you or me...

197
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,832
It's gonna be me.

198
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,834
Morning, Max!

199
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,230
Max! Max! What
are you doing? Hi!

200
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,675
It's me! Hi! Hi!

201
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,715
Chloe!

202
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,957
- Chloe, Chloe!
- I got a bad situation.

203
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,096
Katie brought
home a new dog from the pound.

204
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,793
She said he's my brother.
I don't want a brother.

205
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,632
I don't even have a bed now.

206
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,791
I'm sleeping on the floor,
like a dog.

207
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,757
Why would Katie do this to me?

208
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,070
Because she's a dog person, Max.

209
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,677
And dog people do weird,
inexplicable things.

210
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,512
Like they get dogs
instead of cats.

211
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,756
Okay, please don't
start now, Chloe.

212
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,075
That is not helping.

213
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,594
Max? Come on,
I'm your friend.

214
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,840
Okay? And as your friend,
I gotta be honest with you.

215
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,831
I don't care about you
or your problems.

216
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,439
But if you don't do something

217
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,114
about this guy, and soon,

218
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:34,113
your perfect little life
with your dumb, bleh, human

219
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,430
is gonna be over, forever.

220
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,959
Forever?

221
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,031
Forever. Yeah,
that's what I just...

222
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:43,510
Why is this mouse
on my paw still?

223
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:47,030
Look, if you really
want to get your turf back

224
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,296
you're gonna have to start
acting like the alpha dog.

225
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,958
Right. Alpha dog.

226
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,196
I can do that.

227
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,056
Okay, okay.
Please don't go!

228
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,354
This time, really don't go.

229
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,376
I'm running late.
I gotta go. Wait, wait. Stay!

230
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,160
Stay for the trick.
"Spin!" I'm doing "spin."

231
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,656
You guys be good.
I'll see you later.

232
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,680
Wait. No, look...

233
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,880
Okay, Max.

234
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,718
Listen, Duke.
I'm not sure if you're aware,

235
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:18,310
but one of those
food bowls, technically...

236
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,078
It's reserved for...

237
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,913
I know, maybe you didn't
read the names, but...

238
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,354
That's my bowl.
Mmm.

239
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,632
- I know that it...
- Hey...

240
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,352
I was just thinking,
I don't know,

241
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,511
maybe we could institute
some ground rules.

242
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,830
I just thought that...

243
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,269
Or not.
I don't need a bowl.

244
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,360
Here again?

245
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,555
Rodent!
Ah!

246
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,354
Oh, Duke.

247
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,919
Duke, Katie is not...

248
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,514
Katie's gonna be so upset
when she sees that.

249
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,393
Katie's gonna flip out...

250
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,910
When she sees how you
trashed her whole place.

251
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,315
Oh, it's just one vase.

252
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,596
Is it, Duke? Is it?

253
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,191
Oh, that's a shame.

254
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,035
What are you doing?

255
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,713
Whoa, what am I doing?

256
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,633
Nothing.
I'm a cute little doggy.

257
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,236
Katie knows I wouldn't
do anything like this.

258
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,879
No, no. Whoa!

259
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,480
Mmm.

260
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:28,154
This could only be the work
of a dangerous stray,

261
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,957
who hasn't laid down a
foundation of trust.

262
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,235
You're the new dog.

263
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,719
And, Duke, what'd you
go and do this for?

264
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,799
I'm gonna...
What? Bite me?

265
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,439
Rip my face off?

266
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,591
Perfect. Wait till
Katie finds out.

267
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:46,228
Oh! Help, Katie!
Thank goodness you're here.

268
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:50,194
I tried to stop him,
but he's crazy!

269
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,438
Now, sit.

270
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,596
Okay, okay, okay.

271
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,558
Lay down.

272
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,152
Good boy.

273
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,279
Hi, Max.

274
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,634
Hey, Gidget.

275
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,358
Who's your new roommate?

276
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,953
Is it a girl dog or a boy dog?

277
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,720
Not that I care.
It doesn't matter to me.

278
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,149
Oh, that's nobody, Gidget.
He's just visiting.

279
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,510
Yeah, he's gonna be gone soon.

280
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,114
Hey, what's up?

281
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,235
Oh, hi.

282
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,191
Your hat is the best
hat I've ever seen.

283
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,360
Hey.

284
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,436
Uh, excuse me.
Genius!

285
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,113
You forgot my leash.

286
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,320
Never mind.

287
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,872
Hey, fellas, how's it...

288
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,638
Hey, fellas, how's it...

289
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,119
Hey, fellas...

290
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,714
Oh, uh...
Say, Duke...

291
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,995
Yes?

292
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,833
Be a good lad and bring
me a stick, won't you?

293
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:14,112
It would please me to
chew on a stick just now.

294
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,669
You heard me. Fetch.

295
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,191
Nah, nah, nah, nah.
Nah, not that one.

296
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,191
That one doesn't please me.

297
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,839
Find a really good one, Duke.

298
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,871
Yeah, that's it.

299
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,150
Hey, Max. Boy!
Oh, wow.

300
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,709
There are a ton of
sticks over here, Max!

301
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,576
You should come over and look at them.

302
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,989
Yeah, I wanna make sure I
grab you the right one.

303
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,469
Well, that's
very, uh, thoughtful.

304
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,790
Look at all these sticks!

305
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,315
Whoa!

306
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,595
Help! Help!

307
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,193
Hey, did you hear that?

308
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:03,760
Butterfly!

309
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,599
Butterfly!
Butterfly! Let's get it!

310
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,148
Wha... What's...

311
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,480
Huh?

312
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,234
Whoa!

313
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,954
Help! Help!

314
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,080
So long!

315
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,434
Don't leave me here!

316
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,357
Didn't have to be this way, Max.

317
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,669
Wait!
No hard feelings!

318
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,760
Duke!

319
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,989
Please!

320
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,680
Oy!

321
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,716
What's going on here?

322
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,121
Mind your own business.
Oh, my gosh, what happened to you?

323
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,599
I had a fight.
All right?

324
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,276
With a big, stupid dog.

325
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,555
He lost.

326
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:58,559
Oh, you're headed into dangerous
territory there, kitty-cat.

327
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,875
I'd watch your tone, sunshine.

328
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,558
You know what I'm gonna do?

329
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,188
I'm gonna cut you into
string, ball you up,

330
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,959
and then bat you
around for hours

331
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,951
in a game that
only I understand.

332
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,076
Oh, very nice.

333
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,160
I'll take that!

334
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,514
Wha...

335
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,635
Ooh! Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

336
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,758
You want to start with me,
little raisin?

337
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,439
Okay.

338
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,152
Get your umbrellas out, kitties,

339
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,157
because here they come!

340
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,914
The thunder and the lightning!

341
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,633
Right down on your face!

342
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,595
Gosh, there are a lot
of you up there.

343
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,936
I'm talking about the thunder and
the lightning that's coming down

344
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,235
on all of your collective faces!

345
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,320
Attack on three...

346
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,229
Two...

347
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,916
I just remembered
I gotta be somewhere!

348
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,634
That guy, huh? Am I right?

349
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,475
Okay. You know what?
I'm just gonna...

350
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,392
No offense, but good-bye!

351
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,520
Whoa!

352
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,559
Whoa!

353
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:35,920
Hey!

354
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,994
You little...

355
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,720
Duke?

356
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,708
You came back?

357
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:52,875
Run!

358
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:00,313
It's the po-po! Scram!

359
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,400
Wait!

360
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,076
Two, four, six, eight...
Hmm...

361
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,034
See you tomorrow, Guillermo!

362
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,394
You know it.

363
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,909
Ten...

364
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,035
Eh, okay.

365
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,680
Right.

366
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,560
Uh-huh.

367
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,760
Sheez, did you see that?

368
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:29,840
Yeah, I saw it.

369
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,593
Throw it with your arm,
you lazy weirdo!

370
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,228
- I would not fetch that.
- I'm old-school.

371
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,428
Thanks a lot, Duke.

372
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,800
I don't like to use this phrase

373
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,711
because it's offensive
to our kind,

374
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,791
but you are a bad dog!

375
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,439
Katie's not going to like this.

376
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,471
I can't go to the pound.

377
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,951
What? What's wrong
with you?

378
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,789
Well, Katie just...

379
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,474
She just got me
out of the pound.

380
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,711
And if I go back...

381
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,915
Max, it's the end
of the line for me.

382
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,320
Yes! Mmm...

383
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,839
Why? Why?

384
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,433
What's the matter, Maria?

385
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,118
Maria, your face,

386
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,838
it wears a thousand sorrows.

387
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,678
What is wrong?

388
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,279
Oh, I have come
face-to-face

389
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,749
with the worst thing
in the world.

390
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,792
What? Oh, tell me,
Maria. T ell me now!

391
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,349
I cannot bear another
moment without knowing!

392
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,357
Loneliness.

393
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,592
Max! Max!

394
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,513
Max? Huh?

395
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,998
Hey, I see you, squirrel!

396
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,195
This is not your area!

397
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,429
We marked that tree!

398
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,832
Don't you try and hide!
I can see... Oh!

399
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,355
What was that?

400
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,351
- How dare you!
- Guys, where's Max?

401
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,590
Nobody likes you, squirrels!

402
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,349
Guys, seriously, where is Max?

403
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,192
Calm down, girl.
He's right...

404
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,398
Huh. He is gone.

405
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,480
Oh, it's fine.

406
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:19,195
I heard him screaming after he
disappeared into those bushes.

407
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,231
Max is gone?

408
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:25,033
This is bad.
This is so bad.

409
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,509
Maria, if he is your true love

410
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,431
you must go to him!

411
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,596
Save him! Save him!

412
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,357
Yes! Yes!
Save my true love!

413
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,068
I'm coming, Max!

414
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,793
- Hi, Chloe.
- If anyone asks,

415
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,871
I'm on my way to the
roof to look for Max.

416
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,829
Okay, bye-bye.

417
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,592
Whoa. You see that?

418
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,231
Yeah, give me a second.

419
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,790
Oh! Hey, there,
cute little bunny.

420
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:16,593
Whatcha doing in the
middle of the road?

421
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,599
Bunny!

422
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,319
What's going on?

423
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,599
What the...

424
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,068
Save yourself!

425
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,389
Shut it, human!

426
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,515
Let's do this!
Now!

427
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,551
Now! Yeah!

428
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,232
Get off me!

429
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,278
Wait up!

430
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,152
Get off me, pig!

431
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,834
Get off!

432
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,319
Ow! Ow!

433
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,916
Whoa...

434
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,959
What's happening?

435
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,120
I don't know!

436
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,471
Ripper! Ripper,
where you at?

437
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,994
- Let's go, Ripper!
- I'm busting you outta here!

438
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,272
The revolution has begun!

439
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,793
Liberated forever!

440
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,678
Domesticated never!

441
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:23,955
Yeah!

442
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,436
Who's driving this thing?

443
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,149
Whoo!

444
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,033
Ha, ha!

445
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:03,070
Let's go! Let's go!
Let's go!

446
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,994
Who are you guys?

447
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,754
Huh? Who are we?

448
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,911
Who are we?

449
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,913
We are the Flushed Pets...

450
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,559
Thrown away by our owners

451
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,870
and now we are out for revenge!

452
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,234
It's like a club,

453
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,952
but with biting and scratching.

454
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,039
Take us with you!

455
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,598
I don't think so, pets.

456
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,354
Yeah, you got the stench
of domestication all over you.

457
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,313
You chose your side.
And now you're gonna burn.

458
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,709
No! Stop!
Who you calling "pets"?

459
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,558
I ain't no pet!
You got it all wrong!

460
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,228
We're just like you guys.
We hate humans.

461
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,118
Yeah! That's right!
Hate them.

462
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,714
Oh, man, don't get me started on people.
Am I right, Duke?

463
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:47,229
Yeah, that's why we
burned our collars, man!

464
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,913
We burned them to the ground!

465
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,229
And killed our owners!

466
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,120
Yeah... Wait a minute,
that's too far maybe?

467
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,559
No, they dig it.

468
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,136
Yes, we whacked them.
Yeah, that's right!

469
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,878
Bang, bang with our own paws!

470
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,996
If I had a dime
for every owner I killed...

471
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,080
Oh, yeah!

472
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,354
I'd have a dime.

473
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,638
Because I just killed the one.

474
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,998
Ooh-whoo!

475
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,112
Oh, y'all cold-blooded.

476
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,390
Oh, man, you remind me
of my boy, Ricky.

477
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,794
He died, though.

478
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,638
RIP, Ricky!

479
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:17,158
The truth is, the struggle
could use some more muscle.

480
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,616
All right, look,
I'll tell you what.

481
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,576
We'll bust the both of you out of here.
But understand this.

482
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,953
From now on, you work for me.

483
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,951
That's fine.
Sounds like a fun challenge.

484
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,677
All right, guys, let's do this!

485
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,594
To the sewers!

486
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,479
The sewers?

487
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,359
What are y'all waiting for?
I'm not playing.

488
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,669
I said...

489
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,353
To the sewers!

490
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:51,752
Long live
the revolution, suckers!

491
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,879
I can do it.

492
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,760
Oh!

493
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,359
Max?

494
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,149
Max?

495
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:12,957
Max.

496
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,671
Oh, where are you, Max?

497
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:32,553
Looks like
you could use a little help.

498
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,994
Who said that?

499
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,354
Over here.

500
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,398
In this dark and
foreboding shed.

501
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,395
Uh...

502
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,708
Hello?

503
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:51,070
I can see for miles.

504
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:54,312
If you let me out,
I'll find your friend.

505
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,708
Wow! Really?

506
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,871
Oh! You're so sweet.

507
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,871
You're sweet, too.

508
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,360
Thanks, stranger.

509
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,793
But not too sweet.

510
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:07,390
There's also a salty,
gamey thing going on.

511
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,754
Yeah, that's me.

512
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,354
Come on, let's get you
out of that shed.

513
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,399
Yeah, that's it.

514
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,596
Just step over
the pile of bones.

515
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:18,188
Pile of bones.
Okay, will do.

516
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,390
I sure hope Max is safe.

517
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,590
You're a very thoughtful food.

518
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:25,274
"Food"? I didn't say that.
I said "friend."

519
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,396
I meant food...

520
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,709
Friend.

521
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,995
You know what I meant.

522
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,634
I'm sure lucky
I found you, uh...

523
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,949
Tiberius.

524
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,196
And, yes, this is
a very good thing for you,

525
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,920
this whole "meeting me" thing.

526
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,991
Take off my hood.

527
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:53,955
Ah!

528
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,080
The chain!

529
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,991
Oh! You tried
to eat me!

530
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,439
I'm sorry.

531
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:03,753
You should be sorry.
You deserve to be locked up.

532
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,518
You're a bad, bad bird.

533
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:08,712
I can't help it.
I was born with killer instincts.

534
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,319
That is just no excuse.

535
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,153
You're right.
Even for a predator, I'm selfish.

536
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:15,595
I'm a selfish predator.

537
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,637
It's no wonder
I have no friends.

538
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:18,994
Nobody.

539
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,272
This is hopeless.

540
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,632
Oh, don't...
There's no need to cry.

541
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,836
I'm sorry that I
yelled at you before.

542
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,678
Please, take off the chain.

543
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:31,479
This time I'll help
you. I promise.

544
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,635
Tiberius...

545
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:37,110
This is gonna sound completely
horrible, but, um...

546
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,838
I don't fully trust you.

547
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,159
Oh, no, no, no...

548
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:45,396
But, I guess everyone
deserves a second chance.

549
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,391
And you are just
a lonely, old bird.

550
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,834
And you do have weird manners

551
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,150
because you live in a
weird shed on a roof.

552
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:54,596
So, I'll tell you what.
If you find Max...

553
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,758
I'll be your best friend.

554
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,911
Best friend?

555
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,832
You and me?

556
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,316
Whoa!

557
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,354
Whoo!

558
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,829
Yes!
That sounds nice.

559
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,109
Let's do this.

560
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,958
Okay.

561
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,669
Ah...

562
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,429
So, what does
this Max look like?

563
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,560
Brown and white.

564
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,518
He's a short-hair,
roguishly handsome.

565
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,278
He's got a sparkle in his eye.

566
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,231
He sounds dreamy.

567
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,954
You have no idea.

568
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,509
I mean, what?
Whatever. Shut up.

569
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,760
Mmm-mmm.

570
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,108
If my owner comes

571
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,754
put on the hood and
pretend to be me.

572
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,393
Okay, thank you!

573
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,434
Ugh!

574
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,397
The smell is disgusting...

575
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,709
...-ly good.

576
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,353
This is all so great.

577
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,913
Love it here.

578
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,515
What's...
The...

579
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,556
Pass...
Word?

580
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,079
Password?

581
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,434
Look! Look at me.

582
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,192
I am your leader.

583
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:32,073
The leader does not
recite the password.

584
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,430
The leader makes up
the password, idiots.

585
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,560
Everybody, I'm making up
a new password right now.

586
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,033
The new password is...

587
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,913
"Don't ask the leader
for the password!"

588
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,599
Follow me.

589
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,512
Welcome to the
underbelly, brothers.

590
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,109
Home of the Flushed Pets.

591
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,153
Brothers and sisters!

592
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:22,275
As you see,

593
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:25,790
I've returned from the surface
with two new recruits.

594
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:28,480
These guys are
owner-killers!

595
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,600
Hey, hey!
Settle down!

596
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:35,479
Guys, I want you to tell
them how you did it.

597
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:36,896
Go ahead. Tell them
the whole story

598
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,319
about how you
took out your owner.

599
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,595
Don't leave out nothing.

600
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,239
We love gory detail, here.

601
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,833
Oh, yeah!
Tell us!

602
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,757
Right.
So, tell them, Max.

603
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,638
Okay, so.
I was like...

604
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,800
Well, we were like...

605
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,109
Take that!
Yeah!

606
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,633
Stupid owner.

607
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,677
So, that's who
you're dealing with.

608
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,078
That story bored me to death.

609
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,349
Boring!

610
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,748
Give us detail!

611
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,598
Okay. Max?

612
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,352
Okay, well, uh...

613
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,476
So, there's this thing
in the kitchen...

614
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,669
Yeah. Table!

615
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,193
It's flat.
Toaster!

616
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,231
And then round on
just the end of it.

617
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,355
A spoon?

618
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,993
Yes, a spoon!
Exactly.

619
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,997
You can't hurt
someone with a spoon.

620
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,878
You scoop with a spoon.

621
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,040
How many people wanna know

622
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,256
how to kill somebody
with a spoon?

623
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,157
I do! Oh, yeah!

624
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,793
Okay. Uh, well...

625
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,518
We used the spoon...

626
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:26,314
Hit a button on the
machine on the counter...

627
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,976
Right, and it's got those...
The, uh, you know.

628
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,696
Those blades.
The, uh... It's got blades!

629
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,153
Was it a blender?

630
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,197
You blended somebody?

631
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,240
He talking about
the blender, guys.

632
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,118
Oh, please, tell me
it was a blender!

633
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,760
Hey, buddy, I don't ask what it's
called, we just kill with it.

634
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,279
But it was a blender.

635
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,352
Whoo! Do y'all hear this?

636
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,715
You know who was
like this? Ricky!

637
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,073
Rest in peace!

638
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:51,515
Ricky was the only soldier I had

639
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,148
that was ready to
kill humans on sight.

640
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,197
Everybody else need a pep talk.

641
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,952
Not these two brothers.

642
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:04,714
See, all of us have suffered
at the hands of man.

643
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,074
I mean, take me for instance.

644
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,674
I was a magician's rabbit
for kids' parties.

645
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:12,071
But then bunny tricks
went out of style.

646
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,428
So, what did my owner do?

647
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,079
My owner went and
left magic behind

648
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,639
and made me disappear...

649
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,559
From his life!

650
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,760
Uh-huh.

651
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,831
I lived in a tattoo parlor!

652
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,594
The trainees used
to practice on me!

653
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,751
Until they ran out of space!

654
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,116
I mean, yes,
humans say they love us.

655
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,635
But then they turn around
and throw us out like garbage.

656
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,637
Ain't that right,
Sea-Monkeys?

657
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:37,194
It's not our fault we
don't look like the ad!

658
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,280
Yeah!

659
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:41,912
All right, you guys
are joining the brotherhood.

660
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,896
- It's initiation time!
- Oh, yeah!

661
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,638
The what?
I'm sorry, what time?

662
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,360
Summon the Viper!

663
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,919
Uh, is this Viper poisonous?

664
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:55,753
Because I should warn you,
I'm very allergic to poison!

665
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,635
Ow!

666
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,516
All right.
Show her!

667
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:14,948
Max's collar!

668
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,473
Where is he?

669
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,153
What happened to him?

670
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,958
I ain't saying nothing!

671
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,592
You're gonna tell
us where Max is.

672
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,711
And you're gonna tell us now!

673
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,953
Is this supposed to scare me?

674
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:30,270
I'm a cat.
I land on my feet.

675
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,400
Does it always happen?

676
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,994
Because your head looks like
it's taken a lot of landings.

677
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,160
Do you want me to cut you?

678
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,920
Because I'll cut you this way and that.
You'll look like a waffle.

679
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,115
Okay.

680
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,595
He's too stupid to talk,
and too ugly to eat.

681
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,038
I'm done playing nice!

682
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,151
Where is Max?

683
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,633
Ow.

684
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:50,840
Tell me!

685
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,672
Ooh!

686
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,909
Let me finish... Ow!

687
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,079
Help me! Ow!

688
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,156
Don't look at him.
Look at me.

689
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,912
Nobody can help you!

690
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,508
Where is Max?

691
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:03,755
Okay! Okay!

692
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,911
He's in the sewers!
He got taken!

693
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,234
Please! Have mercy...

694
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,914
Adorable puffy dog!

695
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,310
Snake bite!
Snake bite! Snake bite!

696
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,957
As proof of your allegiance

697
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,712
you will now receive the bite

698
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,553
of a one-fanged,
half-blind Viper

699
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,119
fueled by a diet

700
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:36,676
of anti-human rage!

701
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,198
Who wants to go first?

702
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,231
Uh... Okay,
here's the thing, though.

703
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,240
Tiny Dog.

704
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,359
Can I call you "Tiny Dog"?

705
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,397
It fits you.
Let's admit that.

706
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,560
Look.

707
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,910
Between you and the fat dog,
I like you the best.

708
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,274
Oh, thank you!

709
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,271
Tiny Dog's gonna go first.

710
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,078
Everybody, TD's going first!

711
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,240
No, no, no.

712
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:18,874
Tiny Dog does not want to go first.
Take the fat dog!

713
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,069
Snake bite!

714
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,430
No, no, no.
Stop!

715
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,791
Snake bite!
Snake bite! Snake bite!

716
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,273
No, no, no, no.

717
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,191
Stop!

718
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,997
What are you doing initiating
a couple domestics?

719
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,155
Domestics?

720
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,111
Yeah. We just jumped
those two in the alley.

721
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,077
Slashed off their collars.

722
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:40,832
No, no, no.
That's not true.

723
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,279
You said you
burned your collars.

724
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:45,193
Well, "burned," "lost,"
"had them stolen by cats."

725
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,755
It's all just words,
really, isn't it?

726
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:50,348
You don't deserve to
be marked by the Viper.

727
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,311
Oh, no. We'll just
show ourselves out.

728
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,589
You deserve

729
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,637
to be eaten by the Viper.

730
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,597
Get those leash lovers!

731
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:04,993
Hold on.

732
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,152
Go get them,
Duke. Whoa!

733
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,711
Oh...

734
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:54,472
Uh, fellas, that
was an accident.

735
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:57,353
You squished the sacred Viper!

736
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,597
He's a flapjack.

737
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,633
Oh, Viper!

738
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,270
Viper, you in a better place!

739
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,509
You and Ricky!

740
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,989
You ain't never did
nothing to nobody!

741
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:14,673
Well, you bit a lot
of people, Viper.

742
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,760
So, technically, you might
actually deserve this.

743
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,155
This might be something
that was long overdue.

744
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,878
But it shouldn't have came like this.
Not on my watch.

745
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,672
Get them!

746
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,159
Oh, no!

747
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:30,316
Come on!

748
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,798
Ah! Wait up, Duke!

749
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:52,154
Hyah!

750
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:55,749
We're sorry. Can this be
over now?

751
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:57,989
We've got a problem.

752
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,479
We have so many problems.

753
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,750
Which one do you
mean at this moment?

754
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:08,512
Stop running, dummies!

755
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:09,954
Stop it right now!

756
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:12,435
Hold your breath!
Hold my breath? Ah!

757
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,429
Get them!

758
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:26,714
This is my least favorite part
of this whole thing so far!

759
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,160
Friends!

760
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:46,437
I am afraid that I have
some terrible news.

761
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,437
The squirrels are gonna
take over the world!

762
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:49,600
I knew it!

763
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:52,837
I always said, squirrels are
little shifty little guys.

764
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:55,440
No. We're not doing the squirrel
thing right now. That's not...

765
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:56,600
No!

766
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,757
Max is missing!

767
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,552
He's out there somewhere.

768
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:02,352
Lost. Scared.

769
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,152
So, so handsome.

770
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:06,754
We have got to find him
and bring him home!

771
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:09,678
But the outside world
is loud and scary.

772
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:10,949
Ooh! Is that a hawk?

773
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:14,757
This is my friend, Tiberius.
He's going to help us.

774
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:17,635
He's not going to eat us.
We've already been over it.

775
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,800
Come on, Gidget.
We go out there without a leash...

776
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:21,598
We'll get caught by a net.

777
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:22,680
Or something worse!

778
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:24,353
Yeah, like a hawk!

779
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:27,358
We're wasting time!
Max needs us!

780
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:29,954
Come on, girl, Max doesn't
even know you're alive.

781
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:31,308
Well, I don't care!

782
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:33,869
I love him! I love him
with all of my heart!

783
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:37,396
And I'm gonna go look for Max,
no matter who's with me.

784
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:38,709
So...

785
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,029
Who's with me?

786
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:48,076
All right, fine. Fine.

787
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:50,717
Oh, come on, guys.

788
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,677
I can't believe you.

789
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,234
When I got my claws
caught in the curtains

790
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,158
who pulled me down?

791
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:58,713
Max did.

792
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,838
Buddy, Mel.

793
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:04,032
When you were fixed, who taught
you to sit the comfortable way?

794
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:05,235
Max did!

795
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:06,549
Max did!

796
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,039
Max did.
He did it!

797
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:11,072
And when that random cat
tried to eat Sweetpea

798
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:12,992
who saved him?

799
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:15,111
- It wasn't a random cat.
- It was you.

800
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:17,876
The identity of the random
cat is not the point.

801
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:20,315
We're talking
about who saved him!

802
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:21,440
Max did!

803
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:24,074
We gotta save him.
We gotta go save Max! Yeah!

804
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:28,354
Yeah! Let's go
save Max!

805
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:30,593
Uh, which one is Max, again?

806
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:33,315
Um...

807
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:34,919
Tiberius!

808
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:37,036
No! Bad, bad bird.

809
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:40,432
Nice little guy.

810
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:42,192
Nice little guy.

811
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:43,594
I like this bird.

812
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:45,593
Crazy bird.

813
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:18,755
Come on!

814
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:20,114
We gotta get to shore.

815
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:23,471
I only know the doggy paddle!
And I don't know it well!

816
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:26,754
Swim, Tiny Dog.
Swim!

817
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,028
Duke!

818
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:42,957
Help!

819
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:49,838
Max, grab the ring!

820
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:51,829
I can't!

821
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,115
Keep it up, Max!

822
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:54,240
You're doing...

823
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:56,151
Well, you're not doing great.

824
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:58,311
But you're not drowning,
and that's something!

825
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:07,313
You're almost there!

826
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:22,514
Thanks, Duke.

827
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:24,479
No problem.

828
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:27,029
Finally.
I'm going home.

829
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:28,440
Oh.

830
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:30,511
Isn't home that way?

831
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:33,792
Ah! Seriously?

832
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:45,433
They're going to Brooklyn.

833
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:48,034
They say everyone's going
to Brooklyn these days.

834
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:49,832
It's making a real comeback.

835
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:52,190
I'm not talking about
hipster real estate trends.

836
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:54,590
I'm talking about
vengeance, Tattoo!

837
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,870
Death is coming to Brooklyn.

838
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:58,433
And it's got buck teeth

839
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:00,158
and a cotton tail.

840
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:20,599
Let's go!

841
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:36,908
Whee!

842
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:42,317
Hi, how are you?

843
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:45,712
Chug! Chug! Chug!

844
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,630
What is this crazy joint?

845
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:04,478
This is Pops' place.

846
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:07,632
His owner is never home,
so it's kind of a hot spot.

847
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:09,677
Pops knows everyone
in this city.

848
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:13,276
If he agrees to help us,
Max is as good as found.

849
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:14,839
Cool!
Fabulous!

850
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:50,388
Tell me you got that!

851
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:51,989
Oh, heck yes, I did.

852
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:53,991
What's up, Peanut?
Hey, Buddy.

853
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:55,633
You see Pops around here?

854
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:57,552
Yeah, he's over there.

855
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:00,040
Hey, Pops.

856
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:01,200
Mud and sweet potatoes.

857
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:02,395
Pops!

858
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:04,716
Who's that? What?

859
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:06,791
Oh, hey, Buddy.

860
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:08,833
How you been,
old-timer?

861
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:10,833
Paralyzed.

862
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,072
Great! Listen,
Mr. Pops,

863
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:15,878
our friend Max was taken.

864
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:18,156
Last we heard,
he was lost in the sewers.

865
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:21,716
Buddy said that maybe
you could help us.

866
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:25,037
You know, I do know
a guy in the sewers,

867
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:26,275
but, ah,

868
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:27,913
I don't go out anymore.

869
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:29,837
What a waste of time.

870
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:31,075
Who said that?

871
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:32,519
Oh, I said it.

872
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:34,398
By the way,
I meant no offense, I just...

873
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:35,879
Have you seen yourself?

874
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:37,553
Welly-well,
well, well...

875
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:40,228
Looky what we
apparently have here.

876
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:43,119
Meezy would like
to have a look-see.

877
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:45,396
Myron! Brows!

878
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:48,794
Oh, no.

879
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:50,188
Oh, yes.

880
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:52,555
Me like what me see.

881
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:54,352
Well, what me can see.

882
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:56,397
It's all an attractive blur.

883
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:58,790
Uh... Little lady,
this is my city.

884
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:00,757
I'll find your friend.

885
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:03,070
All right, party's over!

886
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:04,753
Myron! Vacuum!

887
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:13,072
So, where are you from, my
fuzzy angel?

888
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:14,918
Dude, I'm a cat.

889
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:17,071
Well, nobody's perfect.

890
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:27,957
I'm so hungry.

891
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:34,197
Oh, man. Would you
look at that sandwich!

892
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:36,834
All right.
Time to work the gift.

893
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:46,995
No, no, no!

894
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:54,078
Okay, this'll be fine.
We're fine.

895
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:55,639
We can find our way home.

896
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:58,075
We are descended
from the mighty wolf!

897
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:00,271
We have raw, primal instincts

898
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:02,351
that are mere moments away

899
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:04,874
from kicking in
and leading us home!

900
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:06,678
I cannot wait!

901
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:08,751
Here it comes!

902
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:10,792
Anything?

903
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
No.

904
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:13,633
Wait! Oh, I...

905
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,831
No.

906
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,752
I don't know, Duke.

907
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:21,469
Maybe the legend of dogs coming
from wolves is just wrong.

908
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:24,752
Maybe one puppy asked his mom,
"Where did we come from?"

909
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:26,154
And the mom said,
"Woof."

910
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:27,992
And the kid was
like "Oh, wolves?"

911
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:29,832
And she was like,
"Yeah, fine."

912
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,149
Sausage.

913
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:33,834
Huh?
You smell that?

914
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:36,071
Oh, man, it is.

915
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:37,792
Sausage!

916
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:39,592
Well, then,
what are we waiting for?

917
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:41,950
We're coming for you, baby!

918
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:57,115
Lower the ramp, dummy.

919
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:59,193
Who are they?

920
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:02,153
This is Puffball,
Squash-Face,

921
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:04,151
Weiner Dog, Yellow Bird,

922
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:06,880
Eagle-Eye,
Guinea Pig Joe.

923
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:08,920
And, of course,
my girlfriend Rhonda.

924
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:11,708
100% wrong.

925
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:14,079
Good enough.

926
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:17,834
Come on! Let's go!
Move it or lose it!

927
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:20,269
Every bird instinct I have says

928
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:22,670
don't follow a dog on wheels.

929
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:24,716
Um, Mr. Pops, sir.

930
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:27,189
Shouldn't we be
heading to the sewers?

931
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:28,753
Now, if we take the human route,

932
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:30,393
getting there is
gonna take days.

933
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:31,709
You may have lots of time,

934
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:33,916
but for me every breath
is a cliffhanger.

935
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:37,038
So, we gotta take
the secret route.

936
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,594
Okay. The secret
route was death.

937
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:43,233
Well, that's that, I guess.

938
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:44,395
Come on!

939
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:48,399
Get down here!

940
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:54,599
Sweetpea...

941
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:08,112
Keep moving!

942
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:19,789
Oh, no.

943
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:25,275
Stop it! Look away!

944
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:09,950
Come on! I don't
have all day!

945
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:21,839
Yeah!

946
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:28,680
Whee!

947
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,672
Come on, slowpokes!

948
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:42,038
Ugh! What is
that smell?

949
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:44,873
It's poo-poo
with a dash of caca.

950
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:47,919
The scent is getting stronger.

951
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:55,519
Oh, man.

952
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:03,070
Duke, let's eat!

953
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:04,673
Oh, yes!

954
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:16,556
Oh, it smells so good!

955
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:20,514
Oh yes!

956
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:31,277
Sausages!

957
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:34,400
Ah!

958
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:54,911
Come on, boys!

959
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:02,029
Holy schnitzel!

960
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:08,958
We go together Like rama lama
lama ka dinga da dinga dong

961
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:10,872
Remembered forever

962
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,514
As shoo-bop sha wadda wadda

964
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,470
That's the way it should be

965
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:21,517
Wha-oooh, yeah!

966
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:26,512
We're for each other Like a wop
ba-ba lu-bop and wop bam boom

967
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:28,352
Just like my brother is

968
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:30,954
Sha-na-na-na-na-na-na-na

00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,549
We'll always be together Ah!

971
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:38,756
Wha-oooh, yeah!

972
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:57,955
Getting a weird vibe, man.

973
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:02,829
All right, now,
these guys are a bit testy.

974
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,956
So, just let me do the talking.

975
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:08,516
Hey, you crybaby!
Where's the Viper at?

976
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:17,637
Don't you worry, Viper!

977
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:20,519
You will not be forgotten!

978
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:24,397
You will be avenged, Viper!

979
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:26,678
If you don't believe me,

980
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:28,393
you can look at my battle plans.

981
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:30,357
It's all laid out right here.

982
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:33,519
Uh, boss...

983
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:35,870
I can't tell who anyone is.

984
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:38,156
Well, you gotta really
look at it to understand it.

985
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:40,396
That's you guys right here.

986
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:41,874
And, see, that's Brooklyn.

987
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:43,917
That's where we
gonna get them dogs.

988
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:45,599
Bam! Bam!

989
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:50,839
That ball of fluff's
got a screw loose.

990
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,353
Let's skedaddle.

991
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:53,976
You get it,
you see what I'm saying.

992
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,434
Bottom line is, I'm coming
right for you, Tiny Dog!

993
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:59,398
And that big, fat, brown dog?
He gonna get it, too.

994
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:00,595
Tiny Dog?

995
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:02,716
There are lots of
tiny dogs in the city.

996
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:05,189
I mean, you're a tiny dog, okay?
So, let's just go.

997
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:07,715
He also said,
"big, fat, brown dog."

998
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:09,717
Like Max's new roommate.

999
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:10,989
Not necessarily.

1000
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:14,028
Max, Max, Max...

1001
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:15,952
You are gonna get it!

1002
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:18,630
That's kind of hard to dispute.

1003
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:21,439
Hey, you stay away from...

1004
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:22,840
Wait, what?

1005
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:23,920
You know Tiny Dog?

1006
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:27,073
He's my friend!

1007
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:29,231
And some might say my boyfriend!

1008
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:30,799
Uh, nobody says that.

1009
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:32,757
I can't believe
you know Tiny Dog!

1010
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:34,360
That's cool.
It's such a small world,

1011
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:36,112
that's the funny thing about it.

1012
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:37,560
Get them!

1013
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:38,954
Scatter!

1014
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:45,760
Not good!

1015
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:51,640
See you guys later!

1016
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:52,760
Hang on!

1017
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:58,598
Everybody, run!

1018
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:04,834
Derick, you idiot!

1019
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,194
Did they all get away?

1020
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:07,880
Uh...

1021
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:10,675
Phew! That was
a close one!

1022
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:13,518
Oh, nuts!

1023
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:15,756
Yes! We got one!

1024
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:17,833
Oh, good for you guys!

1025
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,638
Yay!
Yeah!

1026
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:21,552
Oh, yes, Tiny Dog,

1027
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:23,233
we got your friend!

1028
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:25,197
Advantage, me!

1029
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:30,550
Uh-oh. Just ignore what
just happened. Okay?

1030
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:33,915
Yes!

1031
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:40,113
You know what?

1032
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:42,555
This may be the sausage talking,

1033
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:43,999
but you're okay.

1034
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:46,116
Right back at you, man.

1035
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:48,231
When I met you, I was all like,

1036
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:50,834
"I don't know
if I like him."

1037
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,150
But now that
I know you, I'm like,

1038
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:55,157
"I like him."

1039
00:59:56,920 --> 00:59:59,832
You know, I saw this
place from the outside

1040
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,353
many times.

1041
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:05,553
Had I known what treasures
awaited within these walls,

1042
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:07,432
I would've broke down that door

1043
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:09,351
a long time ago, I'll tell you!

1044
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:11,518
What are you talking about?

1045
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:13,989
My old owner and I
used to live around here.

1046
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:15,599
Duke, man, wait.

1047
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:17,238
Did you used to have an owner?

1048
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:20,352
Well, it was a long time ago.

1049
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:21,839
I don't want to talk about it.

1050
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:23,678
Yes, you do.
Come on.

1051
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:26,112
I don't know.

1052
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:27,874
But you know what?

1053
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:30,950
He was so cool.

1054
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:32,308
Yeah?

1055
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:34,114
Yeah.

1056
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:36,111
He was the best.

1057
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:50,639
Man, we had fun.

1058
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:55,073
We'd play fetch.

1059
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:03,072
We'd go for walks.

1060
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:06,832
We'd take naps.

1061
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:09,477
We were both big nappers.

1062
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:27,274
I got out one night,
chasing a butterfly, or a car.

1063
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:29,795
By the time I had caught
up with it and ate it...

1064
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:31,439
Probably a butterfly, then.

1065
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:34,353
...I realized I was so
far away from my home

1066
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:36,272
I couldn't find it.

1067
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:39,877
A few days later,
I was picked up by Animal Control.

1068
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:45,310
I had a great thing going.

1069
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:48,791
But I had to go and mess it up.

1070
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:52,158
Duke, we gotta go to your house.

1071
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:53,554
Nah.

1072
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:55,870
Your owner's gonna be relieved!

1073
01:01:56,040 --> 01:01:57,075
Will he?

1074
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:58,200
Yeah, but...

1075
01:01:58,280 --> 01:02:00,316
But he never came for me.

1076
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:02,639
Maybe he...

1077
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:05,391
Maybe he didn't like me.

1078
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:08,353
Of course he liked you.
He was your owner.

1079
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:10,750
I mean, he's probably
worried sick!

1080
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:12,313
I don't know.

1081
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:14,311
Well, I do know and we're going!

1082
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:15,629
Your owner's gonna freak!

1083
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:17,711
I'm freaking out
just thinking about it.

1084
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,000
Okay.

1085
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:23,068
Let's do it!

1086
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:24,880
There they are!

1087
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:26,234
All right, doggy, come on.

1088
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:29,753
Hey, hey, hey!

1089
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:31,296
Where do you think you're going?

1090
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:33,311
Come back here, you dogs!

1091
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:45,989
That rabbit...

1092
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:47,513
He had crazy eyes.

1093
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:50,114
There ain't no curing
what's wrong with that thing!

1094
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:52,555
Gidget, here's an idea.

1095
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:56,673
Maybe there's a dog in the
neighborhood that looks like Max.

1096
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:58,671
Start hanging out with him.

1097
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:00,671
After a while,
you'll think it's him

1098
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:02,153
you'll be done.

1099
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:04,356
We are not just giving up!

1100
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:05,674
We're dedicated.
We're loyal.

1101
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:07,472
We're easily the
greatest pet ever.

1102
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:08,709
We're dogs!

1103
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:10,193
Cat.
Hawk.

1104
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:12,589
Well, congratulations!

1105
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:14,830
Today you're dogs,
whether you like it or not!

1106
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:15,995
Sweet.

1107
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:18,680
Now let's find Max
before that rabbit does!

1108
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:21,149
Break! We're dogs!

1109
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:26,400
Oh.

1110
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:28,357
I don't like it.

1111
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:31,357
Sassafras...

1112
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:38,596
Yep, they were here.

1113
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:41,069
Excellent.
We're closing in!

1114
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:43,515
This is groundbreaking
evil behavior, people.

1115
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:45,320
Groundbreaking!

1116
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:54,480
Oh!

1117
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:56,996
A light bulb just
went off in my brain.

1118
01:03:57,160 --> 01:03:59,196
The bunny has an idea.

1119
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:04,118
Okay, so, uh, how do I look?

1120
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:05,759
You look great.

1121
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:07,912
How do I smell?

1122
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:09,433
Like a dog, Duke.

1123
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:10,749
Relax, man.

1124
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:15,478
There it is.

1125
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:20,278
Well, go on up.

1126
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:21,919
Go scratch at that door.

1127
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:30,510
Remember that sausage factory?
That was fun, huh?

1128
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:31,948
Are you stalling?

1129
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:34,753
No. Why do you
think that?

1130
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:37,229
Let's have a long talk about
why you think I'm stalling.

1131
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:39,276
Duke, you have nothing
to be nervous about.

1132
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:41,351
Your owner is going to
be thrilled to see you.

1133
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:45,754
Okay.

1134
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:52,398
Huh. That car is new.

1135
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:01,711
Can I help you?

1136
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:06,110
No. We're good, thanks.

1137
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:08,117
You're not good.
You look dirty.

1138
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:10,430
And I'm gonna have to ask
you to get off my lawn

1139
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:12,318
before I get, um,

1140
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:14,277
what you have.

1141
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:15,913
This is my lawn.

1142
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:17,832
Duke, maybe we should go.

1143
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,560
And why would Fred get a cat?

1144
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:21,994
He hates cats.

1145
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:23,832
That's one of the things
I love about him.

1146
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,594
Fred? The old guy?

1147
01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:28,519
He, um...

1148
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:31,478
He died.

1149
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:35,634
Duke, maybe I made a mistake,
saying we should come here.

1150
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:37,233
Let's go.

1151
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:39,192
You're a liar!

1152
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:41,316
Max, cats lie all the time.

1153
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:42,919
Don't fall for it!

1154
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:49,588
Who are they?

1155
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:54,593
Hey, this is my home.

1156
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:55,920
Go away!

1157
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:02,676
Duke, it's time to go.

1158
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:06,478
Duke, let's go!
Come on!

1159
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:08,358
This isn't your home anymore.

1160
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:10,789
Why did you bring me here, Max?

1161
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:12,911
Wait a minute.
This is my fault?

1162
01:06:13,080 --> 01:06:14,593
I was trying to help you!

1163
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:16,915
You were trying
to get rid of me!

1164
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:20,316
You know what, Duke?
I don't need this.

1165
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:22,160
I'll see you later.

1166
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:23,240
Gotcha!

1167
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:26,437
Come on, settle down!

1168
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:30,713
Go home, Max!

1169
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,480
Hey, help me out, here!

1170
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:35,431
Hold on!
I'm coming!

1171
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:37,594
Let's go.

1172
01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:40,576
Finally got you, big fella.

1173
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:41,776
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Come on.

1174
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:43,711
This is it for you.

1175
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:50,909
Duke!

1176
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:17,160
Aw.

1177
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:19,392
Koochi koochi koo!

1178
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:34,155
Tiny Dog!

1179
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:38,358
Ah, are you kidding me?

1180
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:41,349
You thought
this was over, Tiny Dog?

1181
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:47,074
Stop!

1182
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:48,955
Huh?

1183
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:53,560
Jab, jab, jab!

1184
01:07:53,720 --> 01:07:54,835
Body blow! Body blow!

1185
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,752
Karate chop to your neck!

1186
01:07:57,880 --> 01:07:59,632
Would you get off me!

1187
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:03,194
Tattoo!

1188
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:07,830
No, no, no.

1189
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:14,798
Oh, TD.

1190
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:16,518
This kills me to say,

1191
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:18,671
but we gotta join forces, man.

1192
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:30,480
Whoo!

1193
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:33,356
We make a great team, Tiny Dog!

1194
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:36,876
Well, mainly, I'm doing all the hard work,
but you're helping!

1195
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,069
Yes, yes, fine.

1196
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:40,720
Just keep your eyes on the road.
You're driving like an animal!

1197
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:42,714
Whoo-hoo!

1198
01:08:43,480 --> 01:08:45,038
What was that?

1199
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:46,798
Oh, that was a pothole.

1200
01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:48,558
You're hitting
things on purpose!

1201
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:51,029
Heh. You know me
too well, TD!

1202
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:53,031
Always keeping me in check.

1203
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:01,949
Do you see the van?

1204
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:03,235
Yeah, I see it.

1205
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:04,992
We're about to hit it.

1206
01:09:30,320 --> 01:09:32,072
Relax, Snowball, I got you.

1207
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:33,792
There he is!

1208
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:35,751
He's got Snowball!

1209
01:09:52,680 --> 01:09:55,911
Look, fellas, this is
not what this looks like.

1210
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:57,553
Shush, you!

1211
01:09:59,160 --> 01:10:00,912
You were gonna eat the boss!

1212
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:03,395
No, no, no. Snowball and I
are on the same side now.

1213
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:05,755
Tell them! Snowball,
tell them!

1214
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:08,036
That raccoon is lying.

1215
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:10,077
He's not the president.

1216
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:16,960
Come on, now.

1217
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:19,114
Come here, you.

1218
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:29,475
Gidget?

1219
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:06,268
Go, Max!

1220
01:11:06,440 --> 01:11:07,793
Right. Okay,
gotta go.

1221
01:11:07,960 --> 01:11:09,393
Thank you! Thank you!

1222
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:12,239
Stay down!

1223
01:11:26,680 --> 01:11:28,159
Duke, hang on!

1224
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:30,040
Whoa!

1225
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:44,560
Duke!

1226
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:45,834
Max? Max!

1227
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:47,791
Oh, get the keys!
Right!

1228
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:49,393
Hurry!
Ha!

1229
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:23,472
Come on, come on.

1230
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:25,272
I got them!

1231
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:29,715
Max!

1232
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:06,714
Remember me!

1233
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:00,872
I feel heroic!

1234
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:02,433
And handsome.

1235
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:04,477
I'm a little wet,
but I still look good.

1236
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:06,358
I look good.

1237
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:12,475
Are you...

1238
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:14,028
Are you okay?

1239
01:14:14,160 --> 01:14:15,354
I'm good.

1240
01:14:15,720 --> 01:14:16,755
I'm good.

1241
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:20,271
Thanks for coming
to save me, Max.

1242
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:24,599
Max!

1243
01:14:24,720 --> 01:14:26,039
Oh, Max!

1244
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:33,879
You need a lift?

1245
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:36,039
Yes, we need a lift!

1246
01:14:36,280 --> 01:14:37,554
Let's go, Tattoo.

1247
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:44,272
Taxi!

1248
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:45,635
Whoa!

1249
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:03,400
Yeah!

1250
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:05,393
Hey, hey...

1251
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:07,074
Uh, Gidget, wait up.

1252
01:15:07,240 --> 01:15:08,878
Oh, hi, Max.

1253
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:09,960
Yeah. Hi. Um...

1254
01:15:10,040 --> 01:15:11,996
Play it cool.

1255
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:14,072
Yeah, I...

1256
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:15,872
I just wanted to...

1257
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:17,559
Look...

1258
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:21,314
Have you ever lived across
from someone your whole life,

1259
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:24,109
but you don't really
appreciate them, until...

1260
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:26,395
I don't know...

1261
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:29,392
Until they're beating up dozens of
animals on the Brooklyn Bridge?

1262
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:31,398
I guess what I'm
trying to say is...

1263
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:33,718
If you ever wanna...

1264
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:34,840
Okay.

1265
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:36,518
Oh, great.
You're in love.

1266
01:15:36,680 --> 01:15:39,035
How gross for everyone.
Now move it!

1267
01:15:39,200 --> 01:15:40,792
Good-bye! See you later!
Good-bye!

1268
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:42,678
Does anyone know where we are?

1269
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:43,840
Bye, Max.

1270
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:45,035
Bye, Gidget.

1271
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:46,428
Okay, bye-bye!

1272
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:47,959
See you guys.

1273
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:50,277
Man, I feel sorry for them.

1274
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:52,471
Gotta run home to their owners.

1275
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:53,640
Not us.

1276
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:56,633
Now, it's back to
our primary mission.

1277
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:59,519
The downfall of the human race!

1278
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:01,318
It is on, humans!

1279
01:16:01,480 --> 01:16:03,198
It is on!

1280
01:16:03,320 --> 01:16:04,469
Yeah!

1281
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:08,149
Mommy! Can I have a bunny?

1282
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:12,073
And a pig and a
crocodile and a lizard?

1283
01:16:15,080 --> 01:16:16,080
Uh-oh.

1284
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:17,673
Yay, bunny!

1285
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:19,595
Jab, jab, jab!

1286
01:16:19,720 --> 01:16:21,995
Body blow! Body blow!
Break-away move.

1287
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:23,480
Aww...

1288
01:16:24,280 --> 01:16:25,456
What's going on?
What's she doing?

1289
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:28,995
Bunny, I'm gonna love you
forever and ever and ever.

1290
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:32,917
Aww. Bunny.

1291
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:06,955
Aw.

1292
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:08,519
Here you go.

1293
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:51,120
Duke, this is the best
part of the day.

1294
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:53,234
Ooh! Is that her?

1295
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:55,231
Nah, no. That's... Wait...

1296
01:18:55,400 --> 01:18:56,799
Yeah, that's her.
That's her.

1297
01:18:58,520 --> 01:19:00,078
Katie!

1298
01:19:00,760 --> 01:19:02,113
There they are!

1299
01:19:02,240 --> 01:19:05,471
Max and Duke,
Duke and Max! Aw!

1300
01:19:05,560 --> 01:19:07,198
My boys!

1301
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:10,239
So, how'd it go?
Great, right? I...

1302
01:19:11,240 --> 01:19:12,240
Uh...

1303
01:19:13,880 --> 01:19:15,996
So, maybe a few bumps.

1304
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:18,628
But I knew this
was gonna work out.

1305
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:21,031
So, who's hungry?

1306
01:19:33,680 --> 01:19:35,591
Welcome home, Duke.

1307
01:19:36,120 --> 01:19:37,439
Thanks, Max.

1308
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:50,832
Come on, man.
Hurry it up.

1309
01:20:50,920 --> 01:20:52,592
Okay.

1310
01:20:52,720 --> 01:20:54,517
I'm coming, I'm coming.

1311
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:55,600
Sheesh!

1312
01:20:59,320 --> 01:21:01,117
Welcome, my dogs.

1313
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:02,953
Oh, you guys look weird.

1314
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:04,155
Hurry up, come on in.

1315
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:11,795
You said it was a costume party.

1316
01:21:11,960 --> 01:21:13,279
Why do you listen to me?

1317
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:24,558
I'm home, Leonard.

1318
01:21:31,960 --> 01:21:34,269
Were you a good boy, Leonard?

1319
01:26:23,080 --> 01:26:25,514
All right, party's over.
