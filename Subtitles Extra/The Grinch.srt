00:06:28,878 --> 00:06:32,043

Ugh!

111
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:00,942
Fine. But I'm going to despise

112
00:07:00,944 --> 00:07:02,875
every second of it.

113
00:07:02,877 --> 00:07:05,409
Come on, Max.

114
00:07:07,111 --> 00:07:09,808
<i>Yes, the Grinch
hated Christmas,</i>

115
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:12,109
<i>the whole Christmas season.</i>

116
00:07:12,111 --> 00:07:14,875
<i>Now, please don't ask why.</i>

117
00:07:14,877 --> 00:07:17,008
<i>No one quite knows the reason.</i>

118
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:19,175
<i>It could be his head</i>

119
00:07:19,177 --> 00:07:21,908
<i>wasn't screwed on just right.</i>

120
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:23,341
<i>It could be perhaps that</i>

121
00:07:23,343 --> 00:07:26,841
<i>his shoes were too tight.</i>

122
00:07:26,843 --> 00:07:29,974
<i>But I think the most likely
reason of all</i>

123
00:07:29,976 --> 00:07:32,242
<i>may have been that his heart</i>

124
00:07:32,244 --> 00:07:35,244
<i>was two sizes too small.</i>

125
00:07:40,909 --> 00:07:42,907
Now, remember, Max,

126
00:07:42,909 --> 00:07:45,007
this is the time of year
when the Whos

127
00:07:45,009 --> 00:07:46,874

00:10:17,204 --> 00:10:19,202
Oh, hello.
Happy holi...

182
00:10:19,204 --> 00:10:20,869
Uh-uh.

183
00:10:36,937 --> 00:10:38,370
Blech!

184
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:48,035
Ah. What's this?

185
00:10:48,037 --> 00:10:49,367
Excuse me.

186
00:10:49,369 --> 00:10:50,901
Are you getting that?

187
00:10:50,903 --> 00:10:53,167
I need it
for my Christmas stuffing.

188
00:10:53,169 --> 00:10:55,769
Mmm... no.

189
00:10:56,903 --> 00:10:59,169
Well, that's not very nice.

190
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:04,101
Oh, sugarplum!

191
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:12,667
<i>Oh, no, I can't today.
I have a list of errands</i>

192
00:11:12,669 --> 00:11:15,667
a mile long, and the babysitter
left the sink backed up.

193
00:11:15,669 --> 00:11:17,834
No, I-I'm not complaining.
I'm venting.

194
00:11:17,836 --> 00:11:19,166
There's a difference.

195
00:11:19,168 --> 00:11:20,700
Okay. Uh, talk to you later.

196
00:11:20,702 --> 00:11:22,733
I-I have to get breakfast
on the table.

197
00:11:22,735 --> 00:11:26,732
Right after I unclog
this drain again.

198
00:11:26,734 --> 00:11:28,866
Ugh! It's like concrete!

199
00:11:28,868 --> 00:11:31,866
- Cindy-Lou, sweetheart, come eat.
- Coming!

200
00:11:31,868 --> 00:11:34,135
Oh.

201
00:11:37,935 --> 00:11:39,433
Buster,
we've talked about this.

202
00:11:39,435 --> 00:11:41,966
- Huh?
- Your brother's head is not breakfast.

203
00:11:44,935 --> 00:11:46,232
Uh?

204
00:11:46,234 --> 00:11:47,666
Blah!

205
00:11:51,434 --> 00:11:52,966
Ah!

206
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,932
Okay.

207
00:12:01,934 --> 00:12:03,798
You all right, Mom?

208
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,932
Me? Oh. Yes. Never better.

209
00:12:05,934 --> 00:12:08,965
Ah. What'd you put down here
anyway, a roller skate?

210
00:12:08,967 --> 00:12:11,432
No. Just batter.
Me and Ms. Wilbur made cookies.

211
00:12:11,434 --> 00:12:13,432
Oh. That explains it.

212
00:12:13,434 --> 00:12:15,264
- Come have some eggs.
- I can't.

213
00:12:15,266 --> 00:12:17,431
I gotta go mail something.
But I made the beds

214
00:12:17,433 --> 00:12:19,198
and put away the twins' toys.

215
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,832
Thanks, sweetheart.
You didn't have to do that.

216
00:12:21,834 --> 00:12:23,264
I don't mind.

217
00:12:23,266 --> 00:12:25,865
- Something's burning.
- Just a second, sweetie.

218
00:12:25,867 --> 00:12:28,764
Bean, don't feed your brother
with your feet.

219
00:12:28,766 --> 00:12:30,431
- Mom! The toast!
- I got it!

220
00:12:38,999 --> 00:12:41,398
Wait. Where are you
going again?

221
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,664
- I told you. To mail a letter.
- Okay,

222
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:45,297
but just come here first.

223
00:12:45,299 --> 00:12:47,199
Mom. I gotta go.

224
00:12:48,999 --> 00:12:52,097
All right.

225
00:12:52,099 --> 00:12:53,696
Mwa!

226
00:12:53,698 --> 00:12:55,997
Okay. Now you can go.

227
00:12:55,999 --> 00:12:57,696
Thanks, Mom.
Bye, Buster. Bye, Bean.

228
00:12:57,698 --> 00:12:59,330
Don't do anything
I wouldn't do.

229
00:12:59,332 --> 00:13:01,397
Roger that, Mom.

230
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:04,197
Whoo!

231
00:13:04,199 --> 00:13:07,197
Here goes Cindy-Lou Who
as she dashes through the snow

232
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:09,729
with a very important letter!

233
00:13:09,731 --> 00:13:12,096
Oh, no!
I'm gonna miss the mailman!

234
00:13:12,098 --> 00:13:13,963
Shortcut!

235
00:13:13,965 --> 00:13:16,362
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

236
00:13:16,364 --> 00:13:18,096
Whoo! Whoa! Whoa!

237
00:13:18,098 --> 00:13:19,696
Whoa!

238
00:13:19,698 --> 00:13:22,229
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

239
00:13:22,231 --> 00:13:23,662
Bon appétit!

240
00:13:23,664 --> 00:13:24,796
Whoo-hoo!

241
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:28,662
Oh, no!

242
00:13:28,664 --> 00:13:29,862
Whoo!

243
00:13:29,864 --> 00:13:31,064
Aah...

244
00:13:32,098 --> 00:13:33,762
Watch out!

245
00:13:33,764 --> 00:13:35,728
Aah! Oh!

246
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:37,128
No! My letter!

247
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:38,994
What is wrong with you?

248
00:13:38,996 --> 00:13:40,762
Didn't you see me?
I mean, if that...

249
00:13:40,764 --> 00:13:43,061
if that was a sled, I-I...
well, I'd be dead.

250
00:13:43,063 --> 00:13:45,728
I'm sorry for bumping into you,
but this is really important.

251
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:47,829
Have you seen my letter?

252
00:13:47,831 --> 00:13:49,994
And that right there, Max,
is the true nature

253
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:52,428
of the Who child:
just right to "me, me, me.

254
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:54,994
- My letter. Me, me, me."
- No, you don't understand.

255
00:13:54,996 --> 00:13:57,862
This isn't just a letter.
This is the letter.

256
00:13:57,864 --> 00:13:59,861
Oh... really?

257
00:13:59,863 --> 00:14:02,395
Let me guess.
Small child, December 20,

258
00:14:02,397 --> 00:14:05,395
rabidly searching for a
"really important" lost letter?

259
00:14:05,397 --> 00:14:08,861
Might it be your list
of demands to Santa?

260
00:14:08,863 --> 00:14:11,927
They're not demands.
It's more like a wish.

261
00:14:11,929 --> 00:14:15,327
And what I'm wishing for
is really, really important.

262
00:14:15,329 --> 00:14:17,761
Well, then why send a letter?
I mean, if it's really

263
00:14:17,763 --> 00:14:19,960
that important, you should
just ask him face-to-face.

264
00:14:19,962 --> 00:14:23,794
Oh, but that's right:
no one's ever seen him.

265
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:26,027
Mmm, my bad.

266
00:14:26,029 --> 00:14:28,793
Come on, Max,
let's get out of here.

267
00:14:28,795 --> 00:14:30,962

Leave Mr. Grinch alone.

287
00:15:31,294 --> 00:15:33,292
That's one tough balloon
that you're fighting there.

288
00:15:33,294 --> 00:15:35,158
You old feisty frosty.

Gorgeous Green Goddess."

Oh. How did that get in there?

294
00:15:45,026 --> 00:15:47,191
Hey, I'm sorry
if I made you uncomfy.

295
00:15:47,193 --> 00:15:49,857
We all got to keep
the gray away.

296
00:15:49,859 --> 00:15:52,857
I myself use
Chocolate Explosion.

297
00:15:52,859 --> 00:15:55,324
You know what? If you want
to apologize for something,

298
00:15:55,326 --> 00:15:57,357
apologize for that.

299
00:15:58,926 --> 00:16:01,124
My eyes are burning.

300
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:03,357
Well, don't-don't blame me.
Haven't you heard?

301
00:16:03,359 --> 00:16:06,757
The mayor wants Christmas to be
three times bigger this year.

302
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:08,657
That means
three times the lights,

303
00:16:08,659 --> 00:16:10,923
three times the eggnog,
three times the...

304
00:16:10,925 --> 00:16:13,690
Information needed.

305
00:16:13,692 --> 00:16:15,190
That's a good one.

306
00:16:15,192 --> 00:16:16,424
Oh, I get it.

307
00:16:16,426 --> 00:16:18,856
This is one of
your kidding things.

308
00:16:18,858 --> 00:16:20,757
Finally, something
you said is...

309
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:22,889
actually funny.

310
00:16:22,891 --> 00:16:25,223
Yeah, I do kid a lot,
but no, this is actually...

311
00:16:25,225 --> 00:16:27,923
- Christmas three times bigger!
- Well, you're just gonna have

312
00:16:27,925 --> 00:16:29,889
- a good time with this, aren't you?
- Oh-ho, dear.

313
00:16:29,891 --> 00:16:32,123
- Oh, no, no, no, I-I-I-I...
- I gotta say, it's really nice

314
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:34,256
- to see you laughing.
- Sorry, I-I can't hear you.

315
00:16:34,258 --> 00:16:35,922
I don't speak ridiculous.

316
00:16:35,924 --> 00:16:37,922
Oh, you're a scream.

317
00:16:37,924 --> 00:16:40,022
- Have a nice life. Good-bye.
- I'll see you later.

318
00:16:40,024 --> 00:16:42,189
Whew! Oh, man.

319
00:16:42,191 --> 00:16:44,224
Mr. Grinch.

320
00:17:11,224 --> 00:17:14,290
I'm gonna stay awake
to see Santa!

321
00:17:23,256 --> 00:17:25,354
<i>From the edge of his ledge,</i>

322
00:17:25,356 --> 00:17:27,321
<i>way up in the sky,</i>

323
00:17:27,323 --> 00:17:29,321
<i>the Grinch felt upset,</i>

324
00:17:29,323 --> 00:17:31,853
<i>though he wasn't sure why.</i>

325
00:17:31,855 --> 00:17:33,886
<i>It could've been Christmas,</i>

326
00:17:33,888 --> 00:17:36,154
<i>all that joy and the such,</i>

327
00:17:36,156 --> 00:17:38,654
<i>or some thoughts from his past</i>

328
00:17:38,656 --> 00:17:41,087
<i>that he just
couldn't quite touch.</i>

329
00:17:41,089 --> 00:17:43,220
<i>But whatever it was,</i>

330
00:17:43,222 --> 00:17:45,087
<i>it made his heart moan.</i>

331
00:17:46,656 --> 00:17:48,886
<i>Though he was used to it now,</i>

332
00:17:48,888 --> 00:17:51,387
<i>this being alone.</i>

333
00:17:51,389 --> 00:17:54,020
<i>And now safe in his cave,</i>

334
00:17:54,022 --> 00:17:56,220
<i>and apart from the fray,</i>

335
00:17:56,222 --> 00:17:58,920
<i>he reminded himself...</i>

336
00:17:58,922 --> 00:18:02,153
It is better this way.

337
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:15,952
That's right, yeah.

338
00:18:15,954 --> 00:18:19,186
Just right there.
No. No, not on your brother.

339
00:18:19,188 --> 00:18:20,852
Let Mommy do it.

340
00:18:23,821 --> 00:18:25,019
Whoa! Whoa...

341
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:26,885
Cindy-Lou!

342
00:18:26,887 --> 00:18:28,086
Don't worry, Mom.

343
00:18:33,354 --> 00:18:34,884
Aah.

344
00:18:36,886 --> 00:18:39,319
I'm wearing four ski jackets.

345
00:18:39,321 --> 00:18:41,684
Four jackets?
Aren't you a little hot?

346
00:18:41,686 --> 00:18:44,018
Yep. Sweatin' a little bit.

347
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:46,018
Are you going somewhere?

348
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:48,018
- North Pole.
- Oh. Wow.

349
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:50,018
Any, uh, particular reason?

350
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:52,218
- I got to talk to Santa.
- Santa, huh?

351
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:54,418
Yeah. It's really important.

352
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:57,951
Well, it must be if you need
to go see him in person.

353
00:18:57,953 --> 00:19:00,650
- It sure is.
- Okay, then. Well, good luck,

354
00:19:00,652 --> 00:19:03,783
and I guess I'll see you
in about a month.

355
00:19:03,785 --> 00:19:08,418
Wait. It takes a whole month
to get to the North Pole?

356
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:10,151
Oh, yeah. At least.

357
00:19:10,153 --> 00:19:12,418
Christmas will be over
by the time I got there.

358
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:16,150
Ah, that's true. Now, we
would miss you at Christmas.

359
00:19:16,152 --> 00:19:20,650
Wow. I guess I'm gonna have
to come up with another plan.

360
00:19:20,652 --> 00:19:22,317
Hey, maybe while
you're thinking,

361
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:24,716
you could put the halo
on the angel.

362
00:19:24,718 --> 00:19:26,683
Okay.

363
00:19:26,685 --> 00:19:28,783
You want to take
your jackets off?

364
00:19:28,785 --> 00:19:30,749
Yeah, at least
one or two of them.

365
00:19:32,252 --> 00:19:34,816
No, boys, don't pull
the angel's wings off.

366
00:19:34,818 --> 00:19:36,851
She needs those.

367
00:19:42,252 --> 00:19:45,949
♪ Five gold rings... ♪

368
00:19:53,218 --> 00:19:54,882
So, uh...

369
00:19:54,884 --> 00:19:57,183
what do you want to do today?

370
00:20:00,085 --> 00:20:02,383
♪ A little bit of Monica
in my life ♪

371
00:20:02,385 --> 00:20:05,648
♪ A little bit of Erica by my side... ♪

372
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:08,083
No idea, huh?

373
00:20:08,085 --> 00:20:11,015
Ooh. I got one.

374
00:21:16,915 --> 00:21:19,380
All right, all right,
I'm sorry.

375
00:21:19,382 --> 00:21:21,046
You're a good dog.

376
00:21:21,048 --> 00:21:23,346
But a bad drummer.

377
00:21:24,815 --> 00:21:26,981
What would you like to do?

378
00:21:29,215 --> 00:21:32,814
More than embarrassing
to be beaten by a dog.

379
00:21:34,048 --> 00:21:36,046
Oh. What's that?

380
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:42,112
And checkmate. Again.

381
00:21:45,081 --> 00:21:48,314
What in the world is happening?

382
00:22:07,181 --> 00:22:09,345
What is that?!

383
00:22:09,347 --> 00:22:11,677
It's the most
beautiful Christmas tree

384
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:13,677
you've ever seen!

385
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:15,211
Three times bigger?

386
00:22:15,213 --> 00:22:17,977
Th-Th-That's
a hundred times bigger!

387
00:22:17,979 --> 00:22:20,311
Oh, you just wait
till we light it tonight.

388
00:22:20,313 --> 00:22:23,278
It'll sparkle so bright,
you'll be celebrating Christmas

389
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,378
with the rest of us! Ho-ho!

390
00:22:26,813 --> 00:22:28,710
Oh, man, I can't wait!

391
00:22:28,712 --> 00:22:30,709
I'm gonna keep at it.

392
00:22:30,711 --> 00:22:32,877
- I'll see you later, Grinchy.
- No.

393
00:22:32,879 --> 00:22:34,876
You will not see me later!

394
00:22:34,878 --> 00:22:36,876
And I will not be celebrating!

395
00:22:36,878 --> 00:22:38,178
And that tree...

396
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:41,211
that... tree...

397
00:22:41,213 --> 00:22:44,878
has got to go.

398
00:23:01,878 --> 00:23:04,708
- Come on, Mom!
- Cindy-Lou, look over there.

399
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:07,377
- Wow! That's amazing!
- Thank you.

400
00:23:09,112 --> 00:23:11,177
Ooh, a three-eyed sock monster!

401
00:23:11,179 --> 00:23:13,310
Awesome robot.

402
00:23:13,312 --> 00:23:17,708
Oh, how
marvelous this time of year is.

403
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:22,375
Welcome, Who-ville, to the
annual tree-lighting ceremony.

404
00:23:22,377 --> 00:23:26,242
How spectacular
are these ornaments?

405
00:23:26,244 --> 00:23:28,276
Look what I made, everybody.

406
00:23:28,278 --> 00:23:30,276
It's a Christmas dragon.

407
00:23:30,278 --> 00:23:32,276
It came to me in a dream.

408
00:23:32,278 --> 00:23:33,743
Oh, man.

409
00:23:36,178 --> 00:23:38,741
- Hey, Bartholomew.
- Hey there, Ms. Who.

410
00:23:38,743 --> 00:23:40,641
- Here you go.
- Got it.

411
00:23:40,643 --> 00:23:43,276
Find a good spot for it.

412
00:23:43,278 --> 00:23:44,808
There it goes.

413
00:23:56,277 --> 00:23:59,640
Now, let's get ready
to flip that switch

414
00:23:59,642 --> 00:24:01,740
and light up the sky!

415
00:24:01,742 --> 00:24:03,340
Oh-ho, no.

416
00:24:03,342 --> 00:24:05,941
Not on my watch, you don't.

417
00:24:05,943 --> 00:24:07,940
See you guys soon.
Gonna go find Groopert.

418
00:24:07,942 --> 00:24:10,706
Okay. Have fun. Bye. Say "bye."

419
00:24:10,708 --> 00:24:14,241
Here you go. I hope your big
brother gets what he deserves.

420
00:24:14,243 --> 00:24:15,973
Hey, Groopert.
How's business?

421
00:24:15,975 --> 00:24:17,973
Good. What I can't sell...

422
00:24:17,975 --> 00:24:19,708
I can always eat.

423
00:24:21,309 --> 00:24:24,240
I need to talk to you about
something really important.

424
00:24:24,242 --> 00:24:26,675
- Okay.
- Come on, let's go.

425
00:24:30,375 --> 00:24:33,406
All right,
check this out, Groopert.

426
00:24:33,408 --> 00:24:35,739
I'm gonna stay up
on Christmas Eve this year

427
00:24:35,741 --> 00:24:37,406
and meet Santa Claus.

428
00:24:37,408 --> 00:24:39,906
Whoa, that is crazy!

429
00:24:39,908 --> 00:24:42,339
Yeah, I really got
to talk to him.

430
00:24:42,341 --> 00:24:43,906
About what?

431
00:24:43,908 --> 00:24:46,139
Well, it's really personal.

432
00:24:46,141 --> 00:24:50,406
But I'm going to tell you,
because you're my best friend.

433
00:24:50,408 --> 00:24:52,338
It's about my mom.

434
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:56,239
She works all night
and takes care of us all day.

435
00:24:56,241 --> 00:24:58,273
And it just isn't fair.

436
00:24:58,275 --> 00:25:01,739
She acts like she's fine...

437
00:25:01,741 --> 00:25:05,372
but I know,
it's really hard for her.

438
00:25:05,374 --> 00:25:10,006
So I figured, if anyone
could fix that, it'd be Santa.

439
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:12,938
Wow. And I just asked him
for a turtle.

440
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:14,938
Here we go!

441
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:18,338
- Oh. It's starting!
- Okay, Who-ville, it is time

442
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:21,671
to light this beautiful tree.

443
00:25:21,673 --> 00:25:25,072
...17, 18, 19 and 20.

444
00:25:27,007 --> 00:25:30,339
Okay. Lock and load.

445
00:25:32,773 --> 00:25:34,905
All right,
just attach this here,

446
00:25:34,907 --> 00:25:36,905
and we'll be ready to launch.

447
00:25:40,739 --> 00:25:43,205
I know.
I wish I could see

448
00:25:43,207 --> 00:25:45,071
the look on their faces...

449
00:25:45,073 --> 00:25:47,637
Whoa!

450
00:25:47,639 --> 00:25:50,236
Oh, boy! Oh, boy! Oh, boy!
Oh, boy! Oh, boy!

451
00:25:50,238 --> 00:25:52,870
Oh, boy! Oh, boy! Hold on, hold on! Aah!

452
00:25:52,872 --> 00:25:54,305
Whew! Oh, boy.

453
00:25:55,839 --> 00:25:57,972
Whoa... okay, oh, boy.

454
00:26:02,638 --> 00:26:05,071
That could've been
so much worse.

455
00:26:05,073 --> 00:26:07,236
Aah...!

456
00:26:08,738 --> 00:26:10,370
Let's begin the countdown.

457
00:26:11,771 --> 00:26:14,669
Ten! Nine!

458
00:26:14,671 --> 00:26:17,236
Eight! Seven!

459
00:26:17,238 --> 00:26:18,769
Six!

460
00:26:18,771 --> 00:26:21,070
Five! Four!

461
00:26:21,072 --> 00:26:23,136
- Three! Two!
- Hey!

462
00:26:23,138 --> 00:26:24,836
My dragon can fly!

463
00:26:24,838 --> 00:26:26,869
- One!
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

464
00:26:29,204 --> 00:26:30,669
Oh, my.

465
00:26:30,671 --> 00:26:32,136
No, no, no, no. No!

466
00:26:32,138 --> 00:26:34,235
No! No! Aah!

467
00:26:44,105 --> 00:26:46,835
- Whoa!
- Wow!

468
00:26:46,837 --> 00:26:49,335
Oh, it's beautiful.

469
00:26:49,337 --> 00:26:50,868
There it is.

470
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:55,635
The most beautiful tree
Who-ville has ever seen.

471
00:26:55,637 --> 00:26:57,735
Oh, oh! No! No!

472
00:26:57,737 --> 00:26:59,168
Everyone,

473
00:26:59,170 --> 00:27:01,334
have a wonderful season.

474
00:27:06,836 --> 00:27:09,234
No.

475
00:27:09,236 --> 00:27:11,234
No.

476
00:27:11,236 --> 00:27:13,268
<i>He walked through the crowd,</i>

477
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:14,501
<i>and the sound and the lights...</i>

478
00:27:14,503 --> 00:27:17,134
♪ Ring-a-round the rosies,
a pocket full of posies... ♪

479
00:27:17,136 --> 00:27:20,233
<i>...and his ears heard the thump
of their joy and delights.</i>

480
00:27:20,235 --> 00:27:24,634
<i>And it took him right back
to his earliest years,</i>

481
00:27:24,636 --> 00:27:29,834
<i>to that lost, lonely boy
who cried all of those tears.</i>

482
00:27:29,836 --> 00:27:32,267
<i>That lost, lonely boy,</i>

483
00:27:32,269 --> 00:27:34,801
<i>isolated and sad,</i>

484
00:27:34,803 --> 00:27:37,133
<i>with no home of his own,</i>

485
00:27:37,135 --> 00:27:39,835
<i>no mom and no dad.</i>

486
00:27:45,069 --> 00:27:47,200
<i>And as the Grinch
looked around,</i>

487
00:27:47,202 --> 00:27:49,902
<i>he felt downright scared...</i>

488
00:27:51,234 --> 00:27:53,766
<i>...as he remembered
that Christmas</i>

489
00:27:53,768 --> 00:27:56,399
<i>where nobody cared.</i>

490
00:27:56,401 --> 00:27:58,866
<i>Where nobody showed,</i>

491
00:27:58,868 --> 00:28:01,033
<i>not even a flea.</i>

492
00:28:01,035 --> 00:28:03,033
<i>And there were no cards,</i>

493
00:28:03,035 --> 00:28:05,732
<i>no gifts and no tree.</i>

494
00:28:09,201 --> 00:28:12,632
<i>And as he watched other kids...</i>

495
00:28:12,634 --> 00:28:17,266
- Woop!
- <i>...one thing became clear:</i>

496
00:28:17,268 --> 00:28:21,932
<i>that this was the single
worst day of the year.</i>

497
00:28:24,767 --> 00:28:27,799
<i>And now here it was,
that day once again,</i>

498
00:28:27,801 --> 00:28:30,999
<i>and he felt all those feelings
he felt way back when,</i>

499
00:28:31,001 --> 00:28:33,131
<i>when he'd watch
Whos young and old</i>

500
00:28:33,133 --> 00:28:35,865
<i>all sit down to feast,
and they'd feast,</i>

501
00:28:35,867 --> 00:28:37,298
<i>and they'd feast,</i>

502
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:39,697
<i>and they'd feast,
feast, feast, feast.</i>

503
00:28:40,967 --> 00:28:43,131

could not stand in the least.</i>

I must stop this whole thing.

Why?

528
00:29:57,064 --> 00:30:00,362
For 53 years,
I've put up with it.

529
00:30:00,364 --> 00:30:02,628
Now...

530
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:06,929
I must stop this Christmas
from coming.

531
00:30:06,931 --> 00:30:08,195
But how?

532
00:30:16,197 --> 00:30:19,161
<i>Then he got an idea.</i>

533
00:30:19,163 --> 00:30:21,728
<i>An awful idea.</i>

534
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:25,861
<i>The Grinch got
a wonderful, awful idea.</i>

535
00:30:25,863 --> 00:30:29,263
<i>I know just what to do.</i>

536
00:30:30,897 --> 00:30:34,861
<i>I'm going to steal
their Christmas.</i>

537
00:30:42,961 --> 00:30:45,026
All the trimmings,

538
00:30:45,028 --> 00:30:47,026
all the trappings,

539
00:30:47,028 --> 00:30:50,060
all their gifts and garlands!

540
00:30:50,062 --> 00:30:52,827
When they wake
and see it's gone,

541
00:30:52,829 --> 00:30:56,894
then all their joy and
happiness will be gone as well.

542
00:30:59,062 --> 00:31:01,160
So prepare yourself, Max.

543
00:31:01,162 --> 00:31:03,026
For tomorrow...

544
00:31:03,028 --> 00:31:06,728
We begin!

545
00:31:47,361 --> 00:31:50,058
Genius starts
with the abs, Max.

546
00:31:51,959 --> 00:31:54,258
It's go time.

547
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:56,058
♪ What are the rules
for breakfast today? ♪

548
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:57,957
♪ What are the words
I'm forbidden to say? ♪

549
00:31:57,959 --> 00:31:59,658
♪ I need to let my hair down ♪

550
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:02,324
♪ And grow it like
a real ah, ah, ah. ♪

551
00:32:02,326 --> 00:32:04,291
And now...

552
00:32:04,293 --> 00:32:07,657
the question we
have all been waiting for:

553
00:32:07,659 --> 00:32:10,224
How will I steal Christmas?

554
00:32:10,226 --> 00:32:14,856
Well, prepare to have
your little doggy mind blown.

555
00:32:14,858 --> 00:32:15,992
Poof.

556
00:32:25,759 --> 00:32:27,223
Ta-da!

557
00:32:27,225 --> 00:32:29,223
That's right,

558
00:32:29,225 --> 00:32:31,323
I become...

559
00:32:31,325 --> 00:32:33,923
Santa Claus.

560
00:32:33,925 --> 00:32:36,090
But instead of giving

561
00:32:36,092 --> 00:32:39,023
all the joy and happiness,
I'll take it away.

562
00:32:39,025 --> 00:32:42,290
If he can deliver Christmas to
the whole world in one night,

563
00:32:42,292 --> 00:32:46,723
then I can certainly steal it
from little old Who-ville.

564
00:32:46,725 --> 00:32:48,855
I mean, come on.

565
00:32:48,857 --> 00:32:51,623
What's Santa have that I don't?

566
00:32:52,957 --> 00:32:54,955
That's hurtful.

567
00:32:54,957 --> 00:32:57,723
Um, what are you doing

568
00:32:57,725 --> 00:32:59,389
with my bowling ball?

569
00:32:59,391 --> 00:33:01,855
Chasing it.

570
00:33:01,857 --> 00:33:03,189
And you're taking it where?

571
00:33:03,191 --> 00:33:05,122
- It's a secret.
- All right.

572
00:33:05,124 --> 00:33:07,056
But not without
breakfast. Catch!

573
00:33:07,058 --> 00:33:09,922
Whoa! Waffles! My favorite!

574
00:33:09,924 --> 00:33:11,722
Thanks! See you guys later!

575
00:33:11,724 --> 00:33:14,256
Here we go.

576
00:33:14,258 --> 00:33:17,122
- Hey, Cindy-Lou.
- Oh, hey there, Mr. Cubbins.

577
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:22,956
Ca-caw! Ca-caw!

578
00:33:24,291 --> 00:33:25,624
Woot, woot.

579
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:31,190
- Ready.
- All right. Let's go.

580
00:33:33,757 --> 00:33:36,689
Whoa!

581
00:33:43,257 --> 00:33:44,953
Hold on!

582
00:33:44,955 --> 00:33:46,953
Whoo!

583
00:33:46,955 --> 00:33:48,290
Yeah!

584
00:33:55,122 --> 00:33:57,623
Let's go, let's go.
Let's move.

585
00:34:01,322 --> 00:34:03,220
Hang on.

586
00:34:03,222 --> 00:34:06,089
- Whoo!
- And... dismount.

587
00:34:12,322 --> 00:34:15,387
So, what do we know?

588
00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:17,719
Waffles are delicious.

589
00:34:17,721 --> 00:34:20,154
Super delicious. But I meant
about meeting Santa.

590
00:34:20,156 --> 00:34:22,852
We know no one's ever done it.

591
00:34:22,854 --> 00:34:23,952
Hmm...

592
00:34:23,954 --> 00:34:25,952
Okay. How about this?

593
00:34:25,954 --> 00:34:27,952
I'm going to sit
in the living room

594
00:34:27,954 --> 00:34:30,719
with my eyes wide open
like this,

595
00:34:30,721 --> 00:34:34,719
and if I start to drift off,
I'll just open them wider!

596
00:34:34,721 --> 00:34:37,685
Um, I'm pretty sure
you're gonna fall asleep.

597
00:34:37,687 --> 00:34:40,119
- And by the time you wake up...
- He'll be gone.

598
00:34:40,121 --> 00:34:42,718
Nothing but cookie crumbs.

599
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,718
Yeah, you're right.

600
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,718
- I got it!
- Tell me!

601
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,219
Maple syrup.

602
00:34:48,221 --> 00:34:50,119
All right, maple syrup.

603
00:34:50,121 --> 00:34:52,353
We pour it on the roof,
the reindeer get stuck,

604
00:34:52,355 --> 00:34:54,185
and then they can't fly away.

605
00:34:54,187 --> 00:34:55,353
Science!

606
00:34:55,355 --> 00:34:57,218
Won't the syrup just freeze?

607
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,985
- Good point.
- Also, how do we get

608
00:34:58,987 --> 00:35:00,851
all that syrup on the roof?

609
00:35:00,853 --> 00:35:02,318
Yeah, I got nothing.

610
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,818
Wait a minute.

611
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:09,717
- I think I got it.
- What?

612
00:35:09,719 --> 00:35:13,218
We're gonna need
the whole gang for this one.

613
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:14,651
Okay.

614
00:35:14,653 --> 00:35:16,052
If I'm going to become Santa,

615
00:35:16,054 --> 00:35:19,185
then I need to get
into character.

616
00:35:20,886 --> 00:35:22,884
All right, let's see.

617
00:35:22,886 --> 00:35:23,884
"Christmas Tree."

618
00:35:23,886 --> 00:35:25,017
"Christmas Traditions."

619
00:35:25,019 --> 00:35:26,385
"Christmas Pudding."

620
00:35:26,387 --> 00:35:28,618
How does pudding work its way
into everything?

621
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:30,618
Where is the Santa stuff?

622
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:33,217
Look at this.
Little girls and boys giggling

623
00:35:33,219 --> 00:35:34,984
over sugarplums.

624
00:35:34,986 --> 00:35:36,117
Oh.

625
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:37,817
Look how they did the roof

626
00:35:37,819 --> 00:35:40,884
of the gingerbread house
with vanilla icing.

627
00:35:40,886 --> 00:35:43,751
Little... family of gumdrops.

628
00:35:46,918 --> 00:35:48,251
So dumb.

629
00:35:48,253 --> 00:35:49,985
So, so stupidly dumb.

630
00:35:51,018 --> 00:35:52,284
Ah, here we are.

631
00:35:52,286 --> 00:35:54,050
"The Legend of Santa Claus."

632
00:35:54,052 --> 00:35:56,016
Red suit, white beard,

633
00:35:56,018 --> 00:35:58,350
always in a jolly mood.

634
00:35:58,352 --> 00:36:00,916
Oh. That's not gonna happen.

635
00:36:00,918 --> 00:36:02,716
Oh, well.
Let's just start

636
00:36:02,718 --> 00:36:05,218
by finding ourselves
some reindeer.

637
00:36:13,352 --> 00:36:15,748
Beautiful.
Isn't it, Max?

638
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:17,648
This, my little friend,

639
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:19,882
is the Rein-Horn.

640
00:36:19,884 --> 00:36:23,149
It perfectly re-creates the
mating call of the reindeer.

641
00:36:23,151 --> 00:36:24,915
Behold.

642
00:36:33,217 --> 00:36:34,915
Oh. Hey there.

643
00:36:34,917 --> 00:36:37,315
Sorry, little goat.
I was calling for a rein...

644
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:41,349
What was that?!

645
00:36:41,351 --> 00:36:43,249
Scram! Skedaddle!

646
00:36:43,251 --> 00:36:45,249
Strange goat.

647
00:36:46,682 --> 00:36:48,847
Now, reindeer migrate,

648
00:36:48,849 --> 00:36:51,847
so maybe we'll catch a few
headed south for the winter.

649
00:36:51,849 --> 00:36:54,114
I also read that they tend
to mate in densely wooded...

650
00:36:54,116 --> 00:36:57,214
Will you stop following us?!

651
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:59,714
Shoo! Away! Go back to the goat farm.

652
00:36:59,716 --> 00:37:01,248
Go eat a can.

653
00:37:03,983 --> 00:37:06,981
All right, now that that's
over, back to the task at hand.

654
00:37:06,983 --> 00:37:10,314
Whew! It's a little crisp.

655
00:37:10,316 --> 00:37:12,713
Oh, it's getting...

656
00:37:12,715 --> 00:37:14,914
really... c-cold.

657
00:37:14,916 --> 00:37:17,713
Oh, goodness!

658
00:37:17,715 --> 00:37:19,148
Can't...

659
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:21,348
feel my lips.

660
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:23,348
Can't... blink.

661
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:25,880
Eyes... frozen!

662
00:37:29,383 --> 00:37:30,946
Max...

663
00:37:30,948 --> 00:37:34,713
we've hit the mother lode.

664
00:37:35,748 --> 00:37:37,880
We'll have 100 reindeer

665
00:37:37,882 --> 00:37:41,180
to pull our...

666
00:37:52,081 --> 00:37:54,181
Huh?

667
00:37:58,181 --> 00:38:00,112
Well, Santa had eight.

668
00:38:00,114 --> 00:38:02,879
He looks like he ate
the other seven.

669
00:38:04,014 --> 00:38:06,314
Watch and learn, Max.

670
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,081
All right.

671
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:34,311
Aah!

672
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,111
Uh-oh.

673
00:38:37,113 --> 00:38:38,147
Aah!

674
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:40,280
Aah!

675
00:38:52,213 --> 00:38:53,943
Aah! Frozen, stinkin'...

676
00:38:53,945 --> 00:38:55,743
Stop. Stop.

677
00:38:57,246 --> 00:38:59,977
Onward, my furry friends.

678
00:38:59,979 --> 00:39:03,710
We're walking toward destiny.

679
00:39:10,745 --> 00:39:13,246
- Let's get in there!
- Whoo-hoo!

680
00:39:14,811 --> 00:39:17,077
All right, you called, we came.

681
00:39:17,079 --> 00:39:19,310
- So what's up?
- Yeah, what's the deal?

682
00:39:19,312 --> 00:39:21,310
Thanks for getting here
so fast, guys.

683
00:39:21,312 --> 00:39:23,179
Follow me.

684
00:39:24,878 --> 00:39:26,976
So, what's the big secret?

685
00:39:26,978 --> 00:39:30,076
Yeah, I don't have very long.
My parents set the timer.

686
00:39:30,078 --> 00:39:32,909
- Dude.
- Don't ask. It's new.

687
00:39:32,911 --> 00:39:35,742
All right, everybody,
brace yourselves.

688
00:39:35,744 --> 00:39:38,209
In exactly 48 hours,

689
00:39:38,211 --> 00:39:42,809
we are going to do something
that's never been done before.

690
00:39:42,811 --> 00:39:44,741
We're gonna...

691
00:39:44,743 --> 00:39:47,076
trap Santa Claus!

692
00:39:47,078 --> 00:39:48,674
♪ Santa Claus ♪

693
00:39:48,676 --> 00:39:51,211
♪ Is coming... ♪

694
00:39:52,777 --> 00:39:55,775
Trap Santa?
Why would we want to do that?

695
00:39:55,777 --> 00:39:57,941
Duh. To steal all his toys.
I love it.

696
00:39:57,943 --> 00:39:59,375
- Oh, yeah!
- That's a great idea!

697
00:39:59,377 --> 00:40:01,641
No, not to steal his toys.

698
00:40:01,643 --> 00:40:03,875
To, um, to talk to him.

699
00:40:03,877 --> 00:40:07,075
- What? Why do you want to talk to him?
- It's personal.

700
00:40:07,077 --> 00:40:09,808
- Yeah, it's kind of personal.
- Well, I don't want

701
00:40:09,810 --> 00:40:11,673
to do it if you
won't tell me why.

702
00:40:11,675 --> 00:40:13,673
- What are you talking about, "personal"?
- Axl,

703
00:40:13,675 --> 00:40:16,342
when you asked to borrow $16
and my mom's suitcase,

704
00:40:16,344 --> 00:40:18,374
did I ask you why?

705
00:40:18,376 --> 00:40:20,740
- No.
- And what about you, Ozzy?

706
00:40:20,742 --> 00:40:22,640
Remember when you
got stuck in that...

707
00:40:22,642 --> 00:40:24,242
All right, all right, okay.
Geez.

708
00:40:24,244 --> 00:40:26,374
I did it
because you're my friend,

709
00:40:26,376 --> 00:40:28,174
and when something
matters to you,

710
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:30,309
that means it matters to me.

711
00:40:31,842 --> 00:40:34,107
- That's beautiful.
- Okay, okay, okay.

712
00:40:34,109 --> 00:40:35,707
You convinced me.

713
00:40:35,709 --> 00:40:37,840
- Count me in, too.
- All right, we're in.

714
00:40:37,842 --> 00:40:40,007
- Great! Now, let's do this.
- Yeah, let's do this!

715
00:40:40,009 --> 00:40:41,241
- Oh, yeah! Awesome!
- Let's make it happen.

716
00:40:41,243 --> 00:40:42,639
Whoa, cool.
That is so cool.

717
00:40:42,641 --> 00:40:45,074
- To the bikes!
- Yeah!

718
00:40:51,775 --> 00:40:53,906
- Cindy-Lou! Dinnertime!
- Let's go, guys! Dinnertime!

719
00:40:53,908 --> 00:40:55,606
- Time to eat!
- Ooh, dinner.

720
00:40:55,608 --> 00:40:57,340
All right, we meet
first thing in the morning.

721
00:40:57,342 --> 00:40:58,939
- Okay.
- All right, see you tomorrow.

722
00:40:58,941 --> 00:41:01,206
- See you guys in the morning.
- Ozzy! Timer!

723
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:03,140
Okay, Mom.

724
00:41:18,008 --> 00:41:20,140
This is the loudest snow

725
00:41:20,142 --> 00:41:22,605
I've ever heard in my life.

726
00:41:22,607 --> 00:41:24,638
You two, go around the back.

727
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:28,039
Wait for me to drop
the sleigh from the roof. Okay?

728
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:31,938
Go, team.

729
00:41:45,273 --> 00:41:46,273
Ah-ah-ah-ah.

730
00:41:54,806 --> 00:41:55,804
Shh.

731
00:42:01,672 --> 00:42:04,038
Aah!

732
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:05,106

00:42:12,106 --> 00:42:13,238

739
00:42:37,304 --> 00:42:38,803

but I think I just saw
Santa Claus.

763
00:44:04,135 --> 00:44:06,635
Let me get another piece.

764
00:44:11,069 --> 00:44:13,166
Today was great.

765
00:44:13,168 --> 00:44:15,366
We did mean things,

766
00:44:15,368 --> 00:44:18,199
and we did them in style.

767
00:44:18,201 --> 00:44:22,000
Max, you know the rules.

768
00:44:22,002 --> 00:44:23,632
You sleep in your bed,

769
00:44:23,634 --> 00:44:25,999
and I sleep in...

770
00:44:26,001 --> 00:44:28,899
Oh, no, no, not you, too.
I don't believe this.

771
00:44:28,901 --> 00:44:31,232
Max, did you teach him
puppy eyes?

772
00:44:37,934 --> 00:44:39,198
Fine.

773
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,198
This one time.

774
00:44:56,034 --> 00:44:57,765
Ah...

775
00:44:57,767 --> 00:44:59,664
Ah.

776
00:46:02,765 --> 00:46:06,629
Mmm! Now, that is
a great cup of coffee.

777
00:46:10,364 --> 00:46:14,062
Max, this morning, you and I
need to do some recon.

778
00:46:14,064 --> 00:46:16,628
Fred, you just sit right there.

779
00:46:16,630 --> 00:46:18,129
And don't touch anything.

780
00:46:19,997 --> 00:46:22,029
Intel, Max,
that's what we're after.

781
00:46:22,031 --> 00:46:23,895
How many houses are
in Who-ville,

782
00:46:23,897 --> 00:46:25,295
and how many Whos?

783
00:46:25,297 --> 00:46:28,828
How many wreaths and trees
and chimney flues?

784
00:46:28,830 --> 00:46:31,094
I'll be in your ear
the whole time,

785
00:46:31,096 --> 00:46:32,228
and whatever you're seeing,

786
00:46:32,230 --> 00:46:34,661
I'll be seeing on the monitor.

787
00:46:34,663 --> 00:46:36,261
Ready? Now, off you go, Max.

788
00:46:36,263 --> 00:46:38,228
Fly, boy.

789
00:46:38,230 --> 00:46:39,928
Fly!

790
00:46:48,196 --> 00:46:51,328
Max, stop socializing.

791
00:46:51,330 --> 00:46:54,896
Now, let's go in for a look.

792
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:58,794
Okay, six houses on Oak Street.

793
00:46:58,796 --> 00:46:59,960
Oh, watch out!

794
00:46:59,962 --> 00:47:01,761
Wha...?

795
00:47:01,763 --> 00:47:05,027
- Huh.
- Okay, go. Go, go, go.

796
00:47:05,029 --> 00:47:07,293
Now, cut through Main Street
and survey the south side.

797
00:47:07,295 --> 00:47:08,993
Merry Christmas!

798
00:47:08,995 --> 00:47:11,127
Look at those
greedy little gift monsters,

799
00:47:11,129 --> 00:47:14,626
loading themselves up
with Christmas junk.

800
00:47:14,628 --> 00:47:17,027
- Okay, Max, turn right here.
- Whoa!

801
00:47:17,029 --> 00:47:19,626
So I woke up this morning,
got dressed, had my coffee,

802
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:21,060
went outside,
looked on the roof.

803
00:47:21,062 --> 00:47:22,760
My sleigh was gone.

804
00:47:22,762 --> 00:47:24,760
My, my, I wonder who took it.

805
00:47:26,195 --> 00:47:28,227
Okay, let's see here.
If we do...

806
00:47:28,229 --> 00:47:29,826
28 houses an hour

807
00:47:29,828 --> 00:47:32,360
for six hours,
that would be sausages.

808
00:47:32,362 --> 00:47:33,726
Sausages?!

809
00:47:33,728 --> 00:47:36,762
Max! Don't even think about it.

810
00:47:40,261 --> 00:47:41,261
Max!

811
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:46,059
Max, are you okay?

812
00:47:46,061 --> 00:47:47,692
Max?

813
00:47:47,694 --> 00:47:48,992
Oh, hey, look, it's me.

814
00:47:48,994 --> 00:47:51,026
Oh, dear. Aah!

815
00:47:51,028 --> 00:47:53,658
Bad dog.

816
00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:56,194
Fred, we're home!

817
00:47:57,194 --> 00:47:59,625
Fred...?

818
00:47:59,627 --> 00:48:01,991
What are you... doing?

819
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:07,991
Okay.

820
00:48:07,993 --> 00:48:10,093
Come on, we got work to do.

821
00:48:12,327 --> 00:48:14,861
Now, let's plan our route.

822
00:48:17,027 --> 00:48:19,325
First, now, we go south,
quick jaunt to the east,

823
00:48:19,327 --> 00:48:22,225
and then this house, skip
the subdivision for the moment,

824
00:48:22,227 --> 00:48:25,125
knock off the entire
southeast quadrant of the town,

825
00:48:25,127 --> 00:48:27,358
and then we finish it all up...

826
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:30,124
on Whistling Who Lane.

827
00:48:30,126 --> 00:48:32,657
That's 223 houses

828
00:48:32,659 --> 00:48:35,224
and only seven hours
of darkness to work with.

829
00:48:35,226 --> 00:48:39,057
That means we have to be
fast and focused.

830
00:48:39,059 --> 00:48:42,758
And believe you me,
there will be temptation...

831
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:44,857
all around us.

832
00:48:44,859 --> 00:48:47,190

This is our enemy.

836
00:48:53,092 --> 00:48:55,656
You will want to unwrap it.

837
00:48:55,658 --> 00:48:59,089

838
00:48:59,091 --> 00:49:00,790

And if you can get past
the present,

842
00:49:06,991 --> 00:49:09,225
the only obstacle left is...

843
00:49:10,924 --> 00:49:13,590
...the cookie.

844
00:49:13,592 --> 00:49:16,189
Look at it in all
its red, sugary splendor.

845
00:49:17,591 --> 00:49:19,323
No, no, no.
Look at yourselves.

846
00:49:19,325 --> 00:49:21,291
Discipline. We must...

847
00:49:24,791 --> 00:49:27,156
...resist.

848
00:49:27,158 --> 00:49:29,988
- Are you ready?
- Almost.

849
00:49:29,990 --> 00:49:31,855
Good. Think jolly.

850
00:49:31,857 --> 00:49:34,222
- And fat.
- Okay, I'm ready.

851
00:49:34,224 --> 00:49:35,990
All right, quick.
Everybody, hide.

852
00:49:37,024 --> 00:49:38,789
Three, two, one,

853
00:49:38,791 --> 00:49:40,055
cue Santa!

854
00:49:40,057 --> 00:49:42,756
That means you, Groopert.

855
00:49:46,857 --> 00:49:50,122
Ho, ho, ho, ho.
Look at this pretty house.

856
00:49:50,124 --> 00:49:52,288
I will leave presents
for the people.

857
00:49:52,290 --> 00:49:54,222
Come on, it's not
the school play, dude.

858
00:49:54,224 --> 00:49:56,987
- Then why do I have to wear the outfit?
- Groopert!

859
00:49:56,989 --> 00:49:58,820
Focus. Just get the cookie!

860
00:49:58,822 --> 00:50:01,188
But I can see the strings.

861
00:50:01,190 --> 00:50:03,288
Stop worrying.
It'll be dark at night.

862
00:50:03,290 --> 00:50:05,187
What if he has a flashlight?

863
00:50:05,189 --> 00:50:07,354
Have you ever seen a picture
of Santa with a flashlight?

864
00:50:07,356 --> 00:50:09,154
- No, but I just...
- Groopert,

865
00:50:09,156 --> 00:50:10,920
just pick up the cookie!

866
00:50:10,922 --> 00:50:13,755
Hmm. What do we have here?

867
00:50:13,757 --> 00:50:16,555
A delicious little cookie.

868
00:50:18,756 --> 00:50:19,920
Aah!

869
00:50:19,922 --> 00:50:21,956
Groopert!

870
00:50:23,589 --> 00:50:24,720
Groopert?

871
00:50:24,722 --> 00:50:26,753
Uh, hey, guys.

872
00:50:26,755 --> 00:50:30,221
Do I still get to eat
the cookie?

873
00:50:33,223 --> 00:50:38,587
All right, so I tinkered
with our sleigh a bit.

874
00:50:38,589 --> 00:50:40,055
Behold!

875
00:50:50,721 --> 00:50:52,086
Look at this, Max.

876
00:50:52,088 --> 00:50:54,619
Now you'll be riding in style.

877
00:50:54,621 --> 00:50:56,885
A throne for a barking prince.

878
00:50:56,887 --> 00:50:58,353
How do you like that?

879
00:51:00,087 --> 00:51:02,686
All right, Fred,
you are the engine

880
00:51:02,688 --> 00:51:04,152
of this great machine.

881
00:51:04,154 --> 00:51:05,353
Understood?

882
00:51:05,355 --> 00:51:07,285
Good.

883
00:51:07,287 --> 00:51:09,818
Now, remember,
this is just a practice run,

884
00:51:09,820 --> 00:51:11,952
but on this team
we practice like we play.

885
00:51:11,954 --> 00:51:14,720
So let's leave it all
out on the snow.

886
00:51:17,087 --> 00:51:19,985
Oh! Okay!

887
00:51:19,987 --> 00:51:23,784
All right, how about that?

888
00:51:23,786 --> 00:51:26,784
Now, let's pick up the pace
and see how she handles.

889
00:51:26,786 --> 00:51:28,252
Oh, ho-ho!

890
00:51:31,221 --> 00:51:33,751
Hang on!

891
00:51:33,753 --> 00:51:36,184
No, no, no. No problem.

892
00:51:36,186 --> 00:51:38,120
It's all... under control.

893
00:51:41,686 --> 00:51:42,753
Whoa!

894
00:51:44,620 --> 00:51:45,917
Aah!

895
00:51:50,786 --> 00:51:51,783
Aah!

896
00:51:57,985 --> 00:52:00,351
We're doing it, Max.
We are doing it!

897
00:52:00,353 --> 00:52:02,652
We will not be...

898
00:52:04,152 --> 00:52:06,083
...stopped?

899
00:52:06,085 --> 00:52:08,250
What happened? Fred?

900
00:52:08,252 --> 00:52:11,217
Oh, um...

901
00:52:11,219 --> 00:52:13,950
sorry, but we don't need
any more reindeer.

902
00:52:13,952 --> 00:52:16,283
No. Go. Get. Shoo.

903
00:52:16,285 --> 00:52:18,050
I have what I need.

904
00:52:37,018 --> 00:52:39,218
It's okay, Fred.

905
00:52:58,649 --> 00:53:01,349
On our own again, Max.

906
00:53:06,883 --> 00:53:09,748
<i>It was the day
before Christmas,</i>

907
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:11,814
<i>and the Whos were abuzz,</i>

908
00:53:11,816 --> 00:53:15,015
<i>all doing the things
that a Christmas Who does.</i>

909
00:53:16,883 --> 00:53:20,646
<i>Some were out buying presents,
others just milled about.</i>

910
00:53:20,648 --> 00:53:23,248
- There you go, sir.
- <i>But the whole town felt joyous,</i>

911
00:53:23,250 --> 00:53:25,348
<i>of that there was no doubt.</i>

912
00:53:25,350 --> 00:53:29,747
<i>The weather was perfect,
and soon snow would fall.</i>

913
00:53:29,749 --> 00:53:31,315
- <i>This surely would be...</i>
- All right, everyone ready?

914
00:53:31,317 --> 00:53:34,315
<i>...the best Christmas of all.</i>

915
00:53:45,782 --> 00:53:47,713
Max! There you are.

916
00:53:47,715 --> 00:53:49,114
Check this out.

917
00:53:49,116 --> 00:53:50,847
Whoa! Ah.

918
00:53:50,849 --> 00:53:53,347
I've been making
lots of cool... Whoa!

919
00:53:53,349 --> 00:53:56,214
...stuff!

920
00:53:56,216 --> 00:53:57,946
Ooh, more coffee.

921
00:53:59,647 --> 00:54:02,180
It's gonna be a big night.

922
00:54:02,182 --> 00:54:04,280
We got all the gizmos
and gazmos we need,

923
00:54:04,282 --> 00:54:06,846
but we still don't have
the proper outfit.

924
00:54:06,848 --> 00:54:09,946
Come on, let's do
a little stitching.

925
00:54:09,948 --> 00:54:12,179
♪ Uh, gifts I'm preparing ♪

926
00:54:12,181 --> 00:54:14,046
♪ For some Christmas sharing ♪

927
00:54:14,048 --> 00:54:18,611

931
00:54:34,014 --> 00:54:36,678

left to do.

00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:38,346
♪ That's him, all right. ♪

933
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:41,678
Max?

934
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:43,678
Do you know what you are?

935
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:46,278
You are a sturdy little fella.

936
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:49,678
And loyal.

937
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:51,045
Very loyal.

938
00:54:51,047 --> 00:54:54,810
In fact, I think
you're the best dog

939
00:54:54,812 --> 00:54:57,178
a Grinch could hope for.

940
00:54:57,180 --> 00:54:59,212
And that is why...

941
00:54:59,214 --> 00:55:01,744
I'm promoting you.

942
00:55:03,645 --> 00:55:05,245
Max...

943
00:55:05,247 --> 00:55:08,879
you will guide
my sleigh tonight.

944
00:55:14,746 --> 00:55:16,211
Ha-ha!

945
00:55:16,213 --> 00:55:18,912
I knew you
wouldn't let me down.

946
00:55:23,846 --> 00:55:25,977
<i>It was now Christmas Eve.</i>

947
00:55:25,979 --> 00:55:28,011
<i>There was joy in the air.</i>

948
00:55:28,013 --> 00:55:32,010
<i>For in just a few hours,
Santa Claus would be there.</i>

949
00:55:32,012 --> 00:55:35,943
<i>And the gifts would be left,
and the stockings all filled.</i>

950
00:55:35,945 --> 00:55:37,943
<i>And the anticipation,</i>

951
00:55:37,945 --> 00:55:41,210
<i>well, it started to build.</i>

952
00:55:41,212 --> 00:55:43,210
Ozzy, what are you doing?

953
00:55:43,212 --> 00:55:45,576
Trying... to get...
myself tired.

954
00:55:47,045 --> 00:55:49,343
All right, eight hours
till Christmas morning.

955
00:55:49,345 --> 00:55:51,876
That's 28,800 seconds.

956
00:55:51,878 --> 00:55:54,310
Okay, and... sleep!

957
00:55:54,312 --> 00:55:56,310
Waffle One, this is Waffle Two.

958
00:55:56,312 --> 00:55:58,143
Are you there? Over.

959
00:55:58,145 --> 00:56:00,808
I read
you loud and clear, Waffle Two.

960
00:56:00,810 --> 00:56:03,343
- This is Groopert, by the way.
- Yeah, I got that.

961
00:56:03,345 --> 00:56:06,210
Oh. I just wanted
to wish you good luck

962
00:56:06,212 --> 00:56:09,775
- with Santa Claus.
- Thanks. Talk tomorrow.

963
00:56:09,777 --> 00:56:13,708
So, you got any
last-minute wishes for Santa?

964
00:56:13,710 --> 00:56:16,275
Yep. I have one great big wish.

965
00:56:16,277 --> 00:56:20,075
Good. Because you deserve
everything you want and more.

966
00:56:20,077 --> 00:56:21,775
Thanks, Mom.

967
00:56:21,777 --> 00:56:24,209
I want the same thing for you.

968
00:56:24,211 --> 00:56:28,209
How did I end up
with such a wonderful daughter?

969
00:56:28,211 --> 00:56:30,342
I don't know.
Sometimes you just get lucky.

970
00:56:30,344 --> 00:56:32,175
Well, then I really did.

971
00:56:32,177 --> 00:56:33,741
Me, too.

972
00:56:33,743 --> 00:56:35,142
I love you, Mom.

973
00:56:35,144 --> 00:56:37,110
I love you, sweetheart.

974
00:56:38,176 --> 00:56:40,509
- Good night.
- Good night.

975
00:57:02,675 --> 00:57:06,806
<i>The Grinch was now
ready to start his big trip.</i>

976
00:57:06,808 --> 00:57:09,873
<i>He stood like a captain
aboard a great ship.</i>

977
00:57:09,875 --> 00:57:13,840
<i>Yes, the time had now come
to take off like a shot.</i>

978
00:57:13,842 --> 00:57:15,273
Here we go, Max.

979
00:57:15,275 --> 00:57:17,973
Let's see what you've got!

980
00:57:17,975 --> 00:57:20,209
Hyah!

981
00:57:23,674 --> 00:57:25,173
What?

982
00:57:25,175 --> 00:57:27,672
Max?

983
00:57:27,674 --> 00:57:29,209
Max, are you okay?

984
00:57:30,242 --> 00:57:31,574
Huh?

985
00:57:38,674 --> 00:57:40,172
Yeah, Max!

986
00:57:40,174 --> 00:57:41,605
Attaboy!

987
00:57:41,607 --> 00:57:42,872
Go, boy! Go!

988
00:57:44,607 --> 00:57:46,805
<i>And down the Grinch came</i>

989
00:57:46,807 --> 00:57:49,239
<i>on his great fateful ride,</i>

990
00:57:49,241 --> 00:57:51,872
<i>toward the good homes
of Who-ville</i>

991
00:57:51,874 --> 00:57:54,604
<i>and the Christmas inside.</i>

992
00:58:01,873 --> 00:58:04,704
<i>He had planned it
and prepped it,</i>

993
00:58:04,706 --> 00:58:06,506
<i>big detail to small.</i>

994
00:58:08,639 --> 00:58:11,138
<i>Yes, he'd get rid
of Christmas now,</i>

995
00:58:11,140 --> 00:58:13,637
<i>once and for all.</i>

996
00:58:13,639 --> 00:58:16,639
You take the outside,
I'll take the inside.

997
00:58:24,073 --> 00:58:26,272
House number one.

998
00:58:42,139 --> 00:58:44,137
<i>He was ready to pounce</i>

999
00:58:44,139 --> 00:58:46,269
<i>and set the score right.</i>

1000
00:58:46,271 --> 00:58:49,803
<i>He'd make up for the past,
and he'd do it tonight.</i>

1001
00:58:49,805 --> 00:58:51,004
Okay...

1002
00:58:51,006 --> 00:58:53,170
now, let's steal Christmas.

1003
00:58:54,704 --> 00:58:56,635
<i>He swept up their presents</i>

1004
00:58:56,637 --> 00:58:58,204
<i>with the speed of a wiz.</i>

1005
00:58:58,206 --> 00:59:01,037
<i>And he knew he'd cause sadness.</i>

1006
00:59:01,039 --> 00:59:04,206
<i>Only theirs now, not his.</i>

1007
00:59:41,970 --> 00:59:44,002
<i>All this excess and nonsense,</i>

1008
00:59:44,004 --> 00:59:45,768
<i>it was all about greed.</i>

1009
00:59:45,770 --> 00:59:47,334
<i>About meaningless stuff</i>

1010
00:59:47,336 --> 00:59:50,068
<i>that they didn't even need.</i>

1011
00:59:50,070 --> 00:59:51,770
Yeah.

1012
00:59:58,170 --> 01:00:00,135
<i>The Grinch went to work.</i>

1013
01:00:00,137 --> 01:00:01,301
<i>He scooped up the toys.</i>

1014
01:00:01,303 --> 01:00:06,869
<i>He raced against time.
He raced against joy.</i>

1015
01:00:10,869 --> 01:00:12,734
<i>He hit a few snags</i>

1016
01:00:12,736 --> 01:00:14,734
<i>as he made his way through.</i>

1017
01:00:14,736 --> 01:00:18,034
<i>An angry orange cat...</i>

1018
01:00:18,036 --> 01:00:19,967
<i>and a sleepwalking Who.</i>

1019
01:00:21,302 --> 01:00:22,566
Huh?

1020
01:00:27,836 --> 01:00:29,735
Thank you, Mommy.

1021
01:00:31,103 --> 01:00:32,866
<i>He stole pop guns and bicycles,</i>

1022
01:00:32,868 --> 01:00:34,599
<i>roller skates, drums,</i>

1023
01:00:34,601 --> 01:00:37,866
<i>checker boards, tricycles,
popcorn and plums.</i>

1024
01:00:39,735 --> 01:00:43,100
<i>Gadgets and gizmos,
and dolls with strange names,</i>

1025
01:00:43,102 --> 01:00:46,766
<i>goofballs and shloof-balls
and video games.</i>

1026
01:01:14,734 --> 01:01:17,198
<i>And he swiped and he poached.</i>

1027
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:19,798
<i>Yes, the stealing was on.</i>

1028
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:22,032
<i>And this day that he hated,</i>

1029
01:01:22,034 --> 01:01:25,599
<i>well, he made it be gone.</i>

1030
01:01:30,034 --> 01:01:33,067
This is it, the last house.

1031
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:42,831
♪ Mmm, mmm,
dashing through the snow ♪

1032
01:01:42,833 --> 01:01:45,630
♪ In a one-dog open sleigh ♪

1033
01:01:48,033 --> 01:01:51,733
♪ One more house to go,
and Christmas goes away. ♪

1034
01:01:54,933 --> 01:01:56,764
Ha!

1035
01:02:02,932 --> 01:02:04,163
Huh?

1036
01:02:06,698 --> 01:02:08,064
Oh, what the heck?

1037
01:02:09,299 --> 01:02:11,096
Ah.

1038
01:02:11,098 --> 01:02:12,196
Huh?

1039
01:02:14,264 --> 01:02:16,563
He's here!

1040
01:02:16,565 --> 01:02:17,999
Whoa. What the...?

1041
01:02:19,665 --> 01:02:22,562
Aah! Whoa. Whoa! Aah!

1042
01:02:32,164 --> 01:02:34,064
How do I get out of this?

1043
01:02:35,098 --> 01:02:38,162
Santa Claus.

1044
01:02:38,164 --> 01:02:39,962
Oh. Uh, hello.

1045
01:02:39,964 --> 01:02:41,962
A little help, please?

1046
01:02:41,964 --> 01:02:43,662
I'll let you down.
Just give me a minute.

1047
01:02:43,664 --> 01:02:45,729
Oh, that would be great.

1048
01:02:45,731 --> 01:02:48,028
I'm coming.
Just trying to remember...

1049
01:02:48,030 --> 01:02:50,028
which cord it is.

1050
01:02:50,030 --> 01:02:51,195
Oh, no!

1051
01:02:51,197 --> 01:02:52,762
I'm so sorry.

1052
01:02:52,764 --> 01:02:54,028
Are you okay?

1053
01:02:54,030 --> 01:02:56,261
Yeah. I-I guess so.

1054
01:02:56,263 --> 01:02:59,195
Let me help you.

1055
01:02:59,197 --> 01:03:01,962
Sit down here.

1056
01:03:01,964 --> 01:03:04,128
- Whew.
- Drink this.

1057
01:03:04,130 --> 01:03:07,328
It'll make you feel better.

1058
01:03:07,330 --> 01:03:09,563
Uh... thanks.

1059
01:03:11,563 --> 01:03:14,728
Wow. I can't believe
it's really you.

1060
01:03:14,730 --> 01:03:16,594
Uh... yeah.

1061
01:03:16,596 --> 01:03:19,160
I'm so sorry about the trap
and everything,

1062
01:03:19,162 --> 01:03:20,861
but I really need...

1063
01:03:20,863 --> 01:03:23,196
Hey. Why are you taking
our Christmas tree?

1064
01:03:25,129 --> 01:03:26,626
Well...

1065
01:03:26,628 --> 01:03:28,693
uh, one of the lights
wasn't working,

1066
01:03:28,695 --> 01:03:31,327
so I thought I'd
take it back to the workshop

1067
01:03:31,329 --> 01:03:33,960
and see if I could fix it.

1068
01:03:33,962 --> 01:03:35,827
I didn't know you did that.

1069
01:03:35,829 --> 01:03:37,327
Yeah. Sure.

1070
01:03:37,329 --> 01:03:40,160
Now, why don't you
go back upstairs to bed,

1071
01:03:40,162 --> 01:03:42,159
and then when you wake up,
the tree will be fixed

1072
01:03:42,161 --> 01:03:43,927
- and your presents will be waiting under it.
- Wait.

1073
01:03:43,929 --> 01:03:45,827
You don't understand.
I don't want presents.

1074
01:03:45,829 --> 01:03:48,660
Of course you do.
Everyone wants presents.

1075
01:03:48,662 --> 01:03:52,193
No, no, really, I don't.
I want you to help my mom.

1076
01:03:52,195 --> 01:03:54,026
Y-Your mom?

1077
01:03:54,028 --> 01:03:57,026
Yeah. She works so hard

1078
01:03:57,028 --> 01:03:59,993
and is always doing stuff
for other people.

1079
01:03:59,995 --> 01:04:03,093
And I just want her
to be happy.

1080
01:04:03,095 --> 01:04:05,792
You want me to help...
your mom?

1081
01:04:05,794 --> 01:04:07,792
You're Santa.

1082
01:04:07,794 --> 01:04:09,792
You make people happy.

1083
01:04:09,794 --> 01:04:13,859
And everyone
should be happy, right?

1084
01:04:13,861 --> 01:04:16,125
Y-Yeah, I...

1085
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:18,892
I guess they should.

1086
01:04:18,894 --> 01:04:20,225
Santa,

1087
01:04:20,227 --> 01:04:22,826
are... are you okay?

1088
01:04:22,828 --> 01:04:23,826
What?

1089
01:04:23,828 --> 01:04:26,192
Uh... yeah. I'm fine.

1090
01:04:27,828 --> 01:04:30,192
Now, why don't you go
back up to bed, hmm?

1091
01:04:30,194 --> 01:04:32,125
Okay.

1092
01:04:32,127 --> 01:04:34,891
I wish you could celebrate
with us tomorrow.

1093
01:04:34,893 --> 01:04:37,192
We all get together and sing.

1094
01:04:37,194 --> 01:04:39,891
It's so beautiful that

1095
01:04:39,893 --> 01:04:43,124
if you close your eyes
and listen,

1096
01:04:43,126 --> 01:04:46,727
all of your sadness
just goes away.

1097
01:04:50,193 --> 01:04:52,890
That sounds nice.

1098
01:04:53,993 --> 01:04:55,191
Huh?

1099
01:04:59,726 --> 01:05:02,024
Thank you, Santa.

1100
01:05:02,026 --> 01:05:04,026
Good night.

1101
01:05:06,826 --> 01:05:08,859
Good-good night.

1102
01:05:21,992 --> 01:05:25,692
I just met
the strangest little Who girl.

1103
01:05:30,658 --> 01:05:33,223
All right, Max. Let's go.

1104
01:05:37,258 --> 01:05:41,022
<i>He tried to forget it,
but the words filled his head,</i>

1105
01:05:41,024 --> 01:05:42,989
<i>and he found himself thinking</i>

1106
01:05:42,991 --> 01:05:45,189
<i>about what the young girl
had said.</i>

1107
01:05:45,191 --> 01:05:47,189
<i>It was hard to imagine.</i>

1108
01:05:47,191 --> 01:05:49,255
<i>Could it really be true?</i>

1109
01:05:49,257 --> 01:05:51,255
<i>But if they could all be happy,</i>

1110
01:05:51,257 --> 01:05:53,955
<i>maybe he could be, too.</i>

1111
01:06:19,190 --> 01:06:20,690
What?

1112
01:06:25,789 --> 01:06:27,988
<i>Her head felt unsteady,</i>

1113
01:06:27,990 --> 01:06:29,954
<i>and her heart was just sick.</i>

1114
01:06:29,956 --> 01:06:32,921
- Oh, no.
- <i>It must be a joke</i>

1115
01:06:32,923 --> 01:06:35,554
<i>or a prank or a trick.</i>

1116
01:06:35,556 --> 01:06:38,254
<i>Who would do such a thing?</i>

1117
01:06:38,256 --> 01:06:41,654
<i>Who would stoop down this low?</i>

1118
01:06:41,656 --> 01:06:44,587
<i>And then one little girl
realized...</i>

1119
01:06:44,589 --> 01:06:46,822
<i>she might just know.</i>

1120
01:06:48,723 --> 01:06:52,987
<i>3,000 feet up,
up the side of Mount Crumpit,</i>

1121
01:06:52,989 --> 01:06:57,786
<i>the Grinch rode with his load
to the tip-top to dump it.</i>

1122
01:06:57,788 --> 01:06:59,253
Keep going.

1123
01:06:59,255 --> 01:07:01,187
We're gonna make it.

1124
01:07:02,621 --> 01:07:04,885
Oh, dear.
Wha... What happened?

1125
01:07:04,887 --> 01:07:08,785
- Where's the decorations?
- All the presents. - Aw, man.

1126
01:07:08,787 --> 01:07:12,052
Mom... it's my fault.

1127
01:07:12,054 --> 01:07:14,152
What... What is?

1128
01:07:14,154 --> 01:07:15,720
All of this.

1129
01:07:15,722 --> 01:07:17,952
I-I trapped Santa last night,

1130
01:07:17,954 --> 01:07:21,986
'cause I wanted to ask him to
do something special for you.

1131
01:07:21,988 --> 01:07:24,319
But I think I made him mad,

1132
01:07:24,321 --> 01:07:27,686
and that's why he stole
everyone's Christmas.

1133
01:07:27,688 --> 01:07:29,685
No. No, no. No, honey,

1134
01:07:29,687 --> 01:07:31,252
this isn't your fault.

1135
01:07:31,254 --> 01:07:33,784
He didn't steal Christmas.

1136
01:07:33,786 --> 01:07:36,252
He just stole stuff.

1137
01:07:36,254 --> 01:07:38,751
Christmas is in here.

1138
01:07:38,753 --> 01:07:43,254
And besides, I already have the
greatest gift I could ever get.

1139
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:46,786
You.

1140
01:07:55,220 --> 01:07:57,884

You don't like it?
Oh, I could take it back.

1222
01:14:03,606 --> 01:14:06,538

wasn't Christmas I hated.
